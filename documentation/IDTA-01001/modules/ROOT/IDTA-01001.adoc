== Preamble

=== Editorial Notes

This document (version 3.0) was produced from June 2022 to January 2023 by the joint sub working group "Asset Administration Shell" of the working group "Reference Architectures, Standards and Norms" of the Plattform Industrie 4.0 and the working group "Open Technology" of the Industrial Digital Twin Association (IDTA). It is the first release published by the Industrial Digital Twin Association.

A major change consists in splitting the overall document into four parts: Part 1 (this document) covers the core metamodel of the Asset Administration Shell, Part 5 covers the AASX package exchange format, Part 3 is a series that covers the predefined data specifications and Part 4 covers the security metamodel. Another major change is that the mapping rules for the different supported exchange formats (XML, JSON and RDF) are moved to the github repositories themselves that also contain the schemata. Part 2, the API Specification, was defined in a separate document from the very beginning.

Version 3.0RC02 was produced from November 2020 to May 2022 by the sub working group "Asset Administration Shell" of the joint working group of the Plattform Industrie 4.0 working group "Reference Architectures, Standards and Norms" and the "Open Technology" working group of the Industrial Digital Twin Association.

Version 3.0RC01 of this document, published in November 2020, was produced from November 2019 to November 2020 by the sub working group "Asset Administration Shell" of the Plattform Industrie 4.0 working group "Reference Architectures, Standards and Norms".

The second version V2.0 of this document was produced from August 2018 to November 2019 by the sub working group "Asset Administration Shell" of the Platform Industrie 4.0 working group "Reference Architectures, Standards and Norms". Version 2.0.l was published in May 2020.

The first version of this document was produced September 2017 to July 2018 by a joint working group with members from ZVEI SG "Models and Standards" and the Plattform Industrie 4.0 working group "Reference Architectures, Standards and Norms ". The document was subsequently validated by the platform’s working group "Reference Architectures, Standards and Norms".

For better readability the abbreviation "I4.0" is consistently used for "Industrie 4.0" in compound terms. The term "Industrie 4.0" continues to be used when standing on its own.

This specification is versioned using https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0] (semver) and follows the semver specification link:#bib36[[36\]].

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp14[BCP 14] https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119[RFC2119] https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8174[RFC8174]footnote:[https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt]:

* MUST word, or the terms "REQUIRED" or "SHALL", mean that the definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.
* MUST NOT This phrase, or the phrase "SHALL NOT", mean that the definition is an absolute prohibition of the specification.
* SHOULD This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course.
* SHOULD NOT This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label.
* MAY This word, or the adjective "OPTIONAL", mean that an item is truly optional. One vendor may choose to include the item because a particular marketplace requires it or because the vendor feels that it enhances the product while another vendor may omit the same item. An implementation which does not include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does include the option, though perhaps with reduced functionality. In the same vein an implementation which does include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does not include the option (except, of course, for the feature the option provides.)

===  Scope of this Document

The aim of this document is to define the structure of the Administration Shell to enable the meaningful exchange of information about assets and I4.0 components between partners in a value creation network.

This part of the document focuses on how such information needs to be processed and structured. In order to define these specifications, the document formally stipulates some structural principles of the Administration Shell. This part does not describe technical interfaces of the Administration Shell or other systems to exchange information, protocols, or interaction patterns.

This document focuses on:

* a metamodel for specifying information of an Asset Administration Shell and its submodels,
* an introduction to the need of mappings to suitable technologies used in different life cycle phases of a product: XML, JSON, RDF, AutomationML, and OPC UA.

This document presumes some familiarity with the concept of the Asset Administration Shell. Some of the concepts are described in Annex A for convenience sake. The concepts are being standardized as IEC standard IEC 63278 series link:#bib44[[44\]]. The main stakeholders addressed in this document are architects and software developers aiming to implement a digital twin using the Asset Administration Shell in an interoperable way. Additionally, the content can also be used as input for discussions with international standardization organizations and further initiatives. Please consult the continuously updated reading guide link:#bib38[[38\]] for an overview of documents on the Asset Administration Shell. The reading guide gives advice on which documents should be read depending on the role of the reader.

===  Structure of the Document

All clauses that are normative have "(normative)" as a suffix in the heading of the clause.

Clause 2 provides terms and definitions as well as abbreviations, both for abbreviations used in the document and for abbreviations that may be used for elements of the metamodel defined in this document.

Clause 3 gives a short introduction into the content of this document.

Clause 4 summarizes relevant, existing content from the standardization of Industry 4.0; i.e. it provides an overview and explains the motives, but is not absolutely necessary for an understanding of the subsequent definitions.

Clause 5 is the main normative part of the document. It stipulates structural principles of the Administration Shell in a formal manner to ensure an exchange of information using Asset Administration Shells. A UML diagram has been defined for this purpose.

Clause 6 explains how to define predefined data specifications, including those for defining concept descriptions.

Clause 7 provides information on the exchange of information compliant to this specification in existing data formats like XML, AutomationML, OPC UA information models, JSON, or RDF.

Clause 8 summarizes the content and gives an outlook on future work.

Annex A contains additional background information on Asset Administration Shell, while a mapping to the requirements can be found in Annex B.

Annex C defines the grammar language used in the specification. Annex E contains information about UML, while Annex D provides the tables used to specify UML classes etc. as used in this specification.

Annex H describes metamodel changes compared to previous versions. Annex F provides some hints for modelers, and Annex G shows selected metamodel diagrams including all inherited attributes for developers.

The bibliography can be found in Annex I.

===  Working Principles

The work is based on the following principle: keep it simple but do not simplify if it affects interoperability.

To create a detailed specification of the Administration Shell according to the scope of Part 1 result papers published by Plattform Industrie 4.0, the trilateral cooperation between France, Italy, and Germany, as well as international standardization results were analyzed and taken as source of requirements for the specification process. As many ideas as possible from the discussion papers were considered. See Annex A for more information.

The partners represented in the Plattform Industrie 4.0 and the Industrial Digital Twin Association (IDTA) and associations such as ZVEI, VDMA, VDI/ VDE and Bitkom, ensure that there is broad sectoral coverage of process, hybrid, and factory automation and in terms of integrating information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT).

Design alternatives were intensively discussed within the working group. An extensive feedback process of this document series is additionally performed within the working groups of Plattform Industrie 4.0 and IDTA.

Guiding principle for the specification was to provide detailed information, which can be easily implemented also by small and medium-sized enterprises.

== Introduction

This document specifies the information metamodel of the Asset Administration Shell.

The general concept and the structure of the Asset Administration Shell is described in IEC 63278-1 (see Figure 1).

.Asset Administration Shell and Related Roles (Source: IEC 63278-1)
image::image2.png[]

These are the main specifics and roles defined for the Asset Administration Shell:

* an Asset Administration Shell has an association to an asset,
* an Asset Administration Shell provides an interface or several interfaces,
* an Asset Administration Shell lists one or several submodels,
* an Asset Administration Shell responsible creates and governs the Asset Administration Shell,
* an Asset Administration Shell user application accesses the information of the Asset Administration Shell via IT interface(s).
* a Submodel template guides the creation of a submodel following the template,
* a Submodel template may reference concept dictionaries and ontologies,
* concept dictionaries and ontologies define the common vocabulary as basis for interoperability,
* submodels may reference the asset services provided by an asset via an asset integration; further services related to the asset can be referenced.

This document specifies a technology-neutral specification of the information metamodel of the Asset Administration Shell in UML. It serves as the basis for deriving several different formats for exchanging Asset Administration Shells, e.g. for XML, JSON, RDF, AutomationML, and OPC UA information models.

Figure 2 shows the different ways of exchanging information Asset Administration Shells. This part of the "Asset Administration Shell in Detail" series is the basis for all of these types of information exchange.

.Types of Information Exchange via Asset Administration Shells
image::image3.jpeg[]

File exchange (1) is described in detail in Part 5 of this document series.

The API (2) based on the information metamodel specified in this document is specified in Part 2 of the document series "Details of the Asset Administration Shell" link:#bib37[[37\]].

The I4.0 language (3) is based on the information metamodel specified in this document link:#bib47[[47\]].

== General

=== Introduction

Before specifying the information metamodel of the Asset Administration Shell, some general topics relevant for the Asset Administration Shell are explained.

Subclause 4.2 describes some general aspects of handling type and instance assets.

Subclause 4.3 explains the very important aspects of identification in the context of the Asset Administration Shell.

Subclause 4.4 provides matching strategies for semantic identifiers and references.

Subclause 4.5 explains the difference between submodel instances and templates.

Subclause 4.6 discusses aspects of event handling.

=== Types and Instances

==== Life Cycle with Type Assets and Instance Assets

Industry 4.0 utilizes an extended understanding of assets, comprising elements such as factories, production systems, equipment, machines, components, produced products and raw materials, business processes and orders, immaterial assets (such as processes, software, documents, plans, intellectual property, standards), services, human personnel, etc..

The RAMI4.0 model link:#bib3[[3\]] defines a generalized life cycle concept derived from IEC 62890. The basic idea is to distinguish between possible types and instances for all assets within Industry 4.0. This makes it possible to apply the type/instance distinction for all elements such as material type/material instance, product type/product instance, machine type/ machine instance, etc. Business-related information is handled on the 'business' layer of the RAMI4.0 model. The business layer also covers order details and workflows, again for both type and instance assets.


====
Note: to distinguish asset 'type' and asset 'instance', the term 'asset kind' is used in this document. The three different relationship classes between assets, especially type assets and instance assets, explained below show why the distinction is so important. The attribute "derivedFrom" in the metamodel is used to explicitly state a relationship between assets that are being derived from one another. Other relationships are not explicitly supported by the metamodel of the Asset Administration Shell, but they can be modelled via the "RelationshipElement" submodel element type.
====


Table 1 gives an overview of the different life cycle phases and the role of type assets and instance assets as well as their relationship in these phases.

This important relationship should be maintained throughout the life of the instance assets. It makes it possible to forward updates from the type assets to the instance assets, either automatically or on demand.



.Life Cycle Phases and Roles of Type and Instance Assets
[cols="20%,22%,58%", options=header]
|===
|*Asset Kind* |*Life Cycle Phase* |*Description*
|Type asset |Development |Valid from the ideation/conceptualization to the first prototypes/test. The 'type' of an asset is defined; distinguishing properties and functionalities are defined and implemented. All (internal) design artefacts associated with the type asset are created, such as CAD data, schematics, embedded software.
| |Usage/ +
Maintenance |Ramping up production capacity. The 'external' information associated to the asset is created, such as technical data sheets, marketing information. The selling process starts.
|Instance asset |Production |Instance assets are created/produced, based on the type asset information. Specific information about production, logistics, qualification, and test are associated with the instance assets.
| |Usage/ +
Maintenance a|
Usage phase by the purchaser of the instance assets. Usage data is associated with the instance asset and might be shared with other value chain partners, such as the manufacturer of the instance asset.

Also included: maintenance, re-design, optimization, and de-commissioning of the instance asset. The full life cycle history is associated with the asset and might be archived/shared for documentation.

|===

The second class of relationships are feedback loops/information within the life cycle of the type asset and instance asset. For product assets, for example, information on usage and maintenance of product instances may be used to improve product manufacturing as well as the design of the (next) product type.

The third class of relationships are feedforward/information exchange with assets of other asset classes. For example, sourcing information from business assets can influence design aspects of products; or the design of the products affects the design of the manufacturing line.


====
Note: the NIST model link:#bib49[[49\]] provides an illustration of the second/third class of relationships.
====


A fourth class of relationships consists between assets of different hierarchy levels. For example, these could be the (dynamic) relationships between manufacturing stations and currently produced products. They could be also the decomposition of production systems in physical, functional, or safety hierarchies. In this class of relationships, automation equipment is seen as a complex, interrelated graph of automation devices and products, performing intelligent production and self-learning/optimization tasks.

Details and examples for composite I4.0 Components can be found in link:#bib12[[12\]]. A composite I4.0 Component is the combination of a complex asset and its Asset Administration Shell. The hierarchy, typically a Bill of Material (BOM) but also any other relationship between different assets, can be represented in one of its submodels.


====
Note: for submodels representing the Bill of Material of a complex asset, the metamodel not only provides the possibility to define relationships (via the submodel element "RelationshipElement", see above), it also explicitly supports the representation of another asset (via the submodel element "Entity"). The term "Entity" is chosen as superordinate concept in this context and refers to either an asset or another item that is not an asset but may be part of a more complex item or asset.
====


====  Asset Administration Shells Representing Type Assets and Instance Assets

An Asset Administration Shell either represents a type asset or an instance asset. Typically, there is a relationship between instance assets and a type asset. However, not every instance asset is required to have a corresponding type asset.

gives an example of how to handle type assets and their derived instance assets. The attribute "assetKind" indicates whether the Asset Administration Shell (denoted by the ": AAS" UML notation for a class instance) represents a type asset or an instance asset. Additionally, attributes are added to show that the attributes of type asset and instance assets typically differ from each other.

.Example: Asset Administration Shells for Type and Instance Assets
image::image4.png[]


====
Note 1: the example is simplified for ease of understanding and only roughly complies with the metamodel as specified in Clause 5. The ID handling is simplified as well: the names of the classes correspond to the unique global identifier of the Asset Administration Shells.
====



====
Note 2: in the context of Plattform Industrie 4.0, types and instances typically refer to "type assets" and "instance assets". When referring to types or instances of an Asset Administration Shell, this is explicitly denoted as "Asset Administration Shell types" and "Asset Administration Shell instances" to not mix them up. Asset Administration Shell types are synonymously used with the term "Asset Administration Shell template".
====



====
Note 3: please refer to 2 for the IEC definition of types and instances. Within the scope of this document, there is no full equivalency between these definitions and the type/instance concepts of object-oriented programming (OO).
====


There shall be a concrete type asset of a temperature sensor and two uniquely identifiable physical temperature sensors of this type. The intention is to provide a separate Asset Administration Shell for the type asset as well as for every single instance asset.

In the example, the first sensor has the unique ID "0215551AAA_T1" and the second sensor has the unique ID "0215551AAA_T2". "0215551AAA_T1" and "0215551AAA_T2" are the global asset IDs of the two assets, i.e. sensors. The Asset Administration Shell for the first sensor has the unique URI "http://T1.com" and the Asset Administration Shell for the second sensor has the unique URI "http://T2.com". The asset kind of both is "Instance". The example shows that the measured temperature at operation time of the two sensors is different: for T1 it is 60 °C, for T2 it is 100 °C. For the time-being we ignore the relationship "derivedFrom" of the two Asset Administration Shells "http://T1.com " and "http://T2.com" with Asset Administration Shell "http://T0215551AA.com".


====
Note 1: even though the HTTP scheme is used for the identifier, please be aware that these identifiers are logical ones. Identifiers do not have to be URLs. At the same time, URLs used as identifiers do not have to refer to accessible content.
====



====
Note 2: the physical unit can be obtained by the semantic reference of the element "measuredTemperature". This is not shown in the example for simplicity reasons.
====


These two instance assets share a lot of information on the type asset (in this example a sensor type), for which an own Asset Administration Shell is created. The unique ID for this Asset Administration Shell is "http://T0215551AA.com", the unique ID of the sensor type is "0215551AA". The asset kind is "Type" and not "Instance". The information shared by all instances of this temperature sensor type is the product class (="Component"), the manufacturer (="ExampleManufacturer"), the English Description (=”precise and fast temperature measurement"), and the value range ("-40 °C / 140 °C").

Now the two Asset Administration Shells of the two instance assets may refer to the Asset Administration Shell of the type asset "0215551AA" using the relationship attribute "derivedFrom".


====
Note 1: in the UML sense, "attribute" refers to the property or characteristic of a class (instance).
====



====
Note 2: if a specific type asset exists, it typically exists in time before the respective instance assets.
====



====
Note 3: the term Asset Administration Shell is used synonymously with the term Asset Administration Shell instance. An Asset Administration Shell may be realized based on an Asset Administration Shell type. Asset Administration Shell types are out of the scope of this document.
====



====
Note 4: in public standardization, the Asset Administration Shell types might be standardized. However, it is much more important to standardize the property types (called property definitions or concept descriptions) or other submodel element types as well as complete submodel types because these can be reused in different Asset Administration Shells.
====



====
Note 5: in the domain of the Internet of Things (IoT), instance assets are typically denoted as "Things" whereas type assets are denoted as "Product".
====


====  Asset Administration Shell Types and Instances

In the previous clause, type assets and instance assets were explained. The obvious question now is how to harmonize Asset Administration Shells and Asset Administration Shell types. The example in shows that the attributes "globalAssetId" and "assetKind" as well as the global Asset Administration Shell identifier (_id_, represented as name of the class) are present for all Asset Administration Shells. However, if there is no standard, the semantics of "id", "globalAssetId" or "kind" are not clear, although they are the same for all Asset Administration Shells. It is also not clear, which of the attributes are mandatory and which are specific for the asset (type or instance), as illustrated in .

This is the purpose of this document: the definition of a metamodel that defines which attributes are mandatory and which are optional for all Asset Administration Shells. The Plattform Industrie 4.0 metamodel for Asset Administration Shells is defined in Clause 5.


====
Note 1: the metamodel of the Asset Administration Shell is suitable for type assets or instance assets. An alternative approach could have been to define two metamodels, one for type assets and one for instance assets. However, the large set of similarities led to the decision of only one metamodel.
====



====
Note 2: the metamodel itself does not require the existence of mandatory submodels. This is another step of standardization similar to the standardization of submodels of the Asset Administration Shell type level.
====



====
Note 3: an Asset Administration Shell type shall be realized based on the metamodel of an Asset Administration Shell as defined in this document. This metamodel is referred to as "Asset Administration Shell Metamodel".
====



====
Note 4: it is not mandatory to define an Asset Administration Shell type before defining an Asset Administration Shell (instance). An Asset Administration Shell instance that does not realize an Asset Administration Shell type shall be realized based on the metamodel of an Asset Administration Shell as defined in this document.

=== Identification of Elements

====  Overview

According to link:#bib4[[4\]], identifiers are needed for the unique identification of many different elements within the domain of smart manufacturing. They are a fundamental element of a formal description of the Administration Shell. Identification is especially required for

* Asset Administration Shells,
* assets,
* submodel instances and submodel templates,
* property definitions/concept descriptions in external repositories, such as ECLASS or IEC CDD.

Identification will take place for two purposes

* to uniquely distinguish all elements of an Administration Shell and the asset it is representing, and
* to relate elements to external definitions, such as submodel templates and property definitions, in order to bind semantics to this data and the functional elements of an Administration Shell.

==== Identifiers for Assets and Administration Shells

In the domain of smart manufacturing, the assets need to be uniquely identified worldwide link:#bib4[[4\]] link:#bib20[[20\]] by the means of identifiers (IDs). The Administration Shell also has a unique ID (see Figure 5).

.Unique Identifier for Administration Shell and Asset (Modified Figure from link:#bib4[[4\]])
image::image6.jpeg[]

An Administration Shell represents exactly one asset, with a unique asset ID. In a batch-based production, the batches will become the assets and will be described by a respective Administration Shell. If a set of assets shall be described by an Administration Shell, a unique ID for the composite asset needs to be created link:#bib13[[13\]].

The ID of the asset needs to comply with the restrictions for global identifiers according to link:#bib4[[4\]]link:#bib20[[20\]]. If the asset features further identifications like serial numbers and alike, they are not to be confused with the unique global identifiers of the asset itselffootnote:[Such additional asset identifiers are contained in _AssetInformation/specificAssetIds_.].

====  What Type of Identifiers Exist?

In link:#bib4[[4\]]link:#bib20[[20\]], two standard-conforming global identification types are defined:

* *IRDI* – ISO29002-5, ISO IEC 6523 and ISO IEC 11179-6 link:#bib20[[20\]] as an identifier scheme for properties and classifications. They are created in a process of consortium-wise specification or international standardization. To this end, users come together and feed their ideas into the consortia or standardization bodies. Properties in ISO, IEC help to safeguard key commercial interests. Repositories like ECLASS and others make it possible to standardize a relatively large number of identifiers in an appropriately short time.
* *IRI* – IRI (link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3987[RFC 3987]) or URI and URL according to link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986[RFC 3986] as identification of assets, Administration Shells and other (probably not standardized, but globally unique) properties and classifications.

The following is also permitted:

* *Custom* – internal custom identifiers such as UUIDs/GUIDs (link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier[universally unique identifiers]/globally unique identifiers), which a manufacturer can use for all sorts of in-house purposes within the Administration Shell.

This means that the IRIs/URIs/URLs and internal custom identifiers can represent and communicate manufacturer-specific information and functions in the Administration Shell and the 4.0 infrastructure just as well as standardized information and functions. One infrastructure can serve both purposes.

CLSID are URIs for GUIDs. They start with a customer specific schema. Hence, Custom should really only be used if the customer-specific identifier is no IRDI nor IRI.

Besides the global identifiers, there are also identifiers that are unique only within a defined namespace, typically its parent element. These identifiers are also called local identifiers. For example, properties within a submodel have local identifiers.

Besides absolute URIs there are also relative URIs.

See also DIN SPEC 91406 link:#bib31[[31\]] for further information on identification.

====  Which Identifiers for Which Elements?

Not every identifier is applicable for every element of the UML model representing the Asset Administration Shell. Table 2 therefore gives an overview on the different constraints and recommendations on the various entities, which implement "Identifiable" or "HasSemantics". Attributes relate to the metamodel in Clause 5.1 and Clause 5.3.

See Annex A for more information on how to create new identifiers and best practices for creating URI identifiers.

.Elements with Allowed Identifying Values
[cols="21%,17%,22%,40%",options="header",]
|===
|*Elements with identifying values* |*Attribute* |*Allowed identifiers (recommended or typical)* |*Remarks*
|xref:AssetAdministrationShell[AssetAdministrationShell] |id |IRI (URL) a|
mandatory

Typically, URLs will be used.

| |idShort |string |optionalfootnote:[Note: in version V1.0 of this specification, idShort was optional for identifiables. This changed in V2.0: idShort was set to mandatory for all referables. With V3.0, idShort was again made optional.]
| |displayName |multi language string |optional
|xref:AssetInformation[AssetInformation] |globalAssetId |IRI a|
recommended

As soon as the Asset Administration Shell is "released" for production or operation, a globalAssetId should be assigned.

An Asset ID may be retrieved e.g., by a QR code on the asset, by an RFID for the asset, from the firmware of the asset, or from an asset database. IEC 61406 (formerly DIN SPEC 91406) defines the format of such Asset IDs.

| |specificAssetId |IRI, Custom a|
recommended

An asset typically may be represented by several different identification properties like for example the serial number, its RFID code etc.

They are used for lookup of Asset Administration Shells in cases the globalAssetId is not available. However, they do not need to be globally unique.

|xref:Submodel[Submodel] with kind = Template |id |IRDI, IRI (URI) a|
mandatory

IRDI, if the defined submodel is standardized and has been assigned an IRDI.

| |idShort |string a|
recommended

Typically used as idShort for the submodel of kind Instance as well

| |displayName |multi language string a|
recommended

Typically used as displayName for the submodel of kind Instance as well

| |semanticId |IRDI, IRI (URI) a|
recommended

The semantic ID might refer to an external semantic model defining the semantics of the submodel.

| |supplementalSemanticId |IRDI, IRI (URI) |optional
|xref:Submodel[Submodel] with kind = Instance |id |IRI (URI), Custom |mandatory
| |idShort |string a|
recommended

Typically, the idShort or English short name of the submodel template that is referenced via semanticId.

| |displayName |multi language string |optional
| |semanticId |IRDI, IRI (URI) a|
recommended

Typically, the semanticId is an external reference to an external standard defining the semantics of the submodel.

| |supplementalSemanticId |IRDI, IRI (URI) |optional
|xref:SubmodelElement[SubmodelElement] |idShort |string a|
mandatory

Typically, the English short name of the concept definition that is referenced via semanticId.

| |displayName |multi language string a|
optional

If no display name is defined in the language requested by the application, the display name is selected in the following order, if available:

* the preferred name in the requested language of the concept description defining the semantics of the element,
* if there is a default language list defined in the application, the corresponding preferred name in the language is chosen according to this order,
* the English preferred name of the concept description defining the semantics of the element,
* the short name of the concept description,
* the idShort of the element.

| |semanticId |IRDI, IRI (URI), Custom a|
recommended

link to a _ConceptDescription_ or the concept definition in an external repository via a global ID

| |supplementalSemanticId |IRDI, IRI (URI) |optional
|xref:ConceptDescription[ConceptDescription] |id |IRDI, IRI, Custom a|
mandatory

_ConceptDescription_ needs to have a global ID. If the concept description is a copy from an external dictionary like ECLASS or IEC CDD, it may use the same global ID as it is used in the external dictionary.

| |idShort |string a|
recommended

e.g. same as English short name

| |displayName |multi language string |optional
| |isCaseOf |IRDI, IRI (URI) a|
optional

links to the concept definition in an external repository, which the concept description is a copy from, or that it corresponds to

|xref:Qualifier[Qualifier] |semanticId |IRDI, IRI (URI), Custom a|
recommended

Links to the qualifier type definition in an external repository

IRDI, if the defined qualifier type is standardized and has been assigned an IRDI.

|===

==== Usage of Short ID for Identifiable Elements

The Administration Shell fosters the use of worldwide unique identifiers to a large degree. However, in some cases, this may lead to inefficiencies. Example: a property, which is part of a submodel, which in turn is part of an Administration Shell, each of which is identified by global identifiers link:#bib4[[4\]].

In an application featuring a resource-oriented architecture (ROA), a worldwide unique resource locator (URL) might be composed of a series of segments, which do not need to be globally unique, see Figure 6.

.Motivation of Exemplary Identifiers and idShort
image::image7.jpeg[]

To allow such efficient addressing by the chaining of elements by an API of an Administration Shell, _idShort_ is provided for a set of classes of the metamodel. It inherits from the abstract class _Referable_, in order to refer to such dependent elements (see 5.1).

Before accessing concrete data provided via a submodel, an application typically checks if the submodel provides the required data, i.e. the semantics of the submodel is checked for suitability. A so-called _semanticId_ should be defined for this submodel as well as the submodel element. This semantic ID helps to easily find the semantic definition of the submodel (see Clause 5.3.2).

=== Matching Strategies

==== Matching Strategies for Semantic Identifiers

When comparing two elements, different use cases should be considered in order to define how these two elements are semantically related. This clause gives first hints on the aspects to consider when dealing with matching semantic identifiers. For example, semantic references including context information as represented in IRDI-Path in ECLASS are not yet considered. Sometimes a concept description is derived from another concept description or is identical to or at least compatible with another concept description. The metamodel foresees an attribute "isCaseOf" for such semantic IDs. However, these are not considered in the matching strategies described in this clause.

*Exact Matching (identical semanticIds) – DEFAULT*

* With exact matching, two semantic IDs need to be string-identical.
** Example: Property with idShort "ManufacturerName" + semanticId 0173-1#02-AAO677#002 and Property with idShort "Herstellername" + semanticId 0173-1#02-AAO677#002 have exactly equal semantics.

*Intelligent Matching (compatible semanticIds)*

* Ignore Versioning
** With intelligent matching, different versions of a concept definition may be matched. For example, if semantic versioning is used to version the concept description, then upward or backward compatible versions can be matched.
** Example: property with idShort "ManufacturerName" + semanticId 0173-1#02-AAO677#002 and Property with idShort "Herstellername" + semanticId 0173-1#02-AAO677#003 have equal semantics.

====
Note: to compare two semantic IDs, knowledge about versioning needs to be available. In the example above, two IRDIs from ECLASS are compared. ECLASS rules ensure that the semantics is always backward compatible for new versions; a new IRDI would be created for breaking changes.
====

* Consider Semantic Mappings
** Existing semantic mapping information can be considered for intelligent matching. Semantic mappings may exist within one and the same dictionary, but also between different dictionaries and ontologies.
** Example: 0112/2///61360_4#AAE530 for nominal capacity of a battery in dictionary IEC CDD and 0173-1#02-AAI048#004 in ECLASS have equal semanticsfootnote:[Semantic mapping files are also used in ECLASS between ECLASS Classic and ECLASS Advanced: https://eclass.eu/support/technical-specification/data-model/basic-advanced-mapping] footnote:[This is the format used for semantic mapping in ECLASS: https://eclass.eu/fileadmin/Redaktion/pdf-Dateien/Wiki/ECLASSXML_3.0/ECLASS_XML/mapping.xsd].
====
Note: this example does not represent an existing semantic mapping; it is only a candidate.
====

====
Note: this example does not represent an existing semantic mapping; it is only a candidate.
====

* Consider Domain Knowledge
** With intelligent matching, domain knowledge available in machine-readable form may be taken into account, such as an "is-a"-relationship between two concept definitions.
** Example: a Hammer drill (0173-1#01-ADS698#010) and a percussion drill (0173-1#01-ADS700#010) are drills for mineral material (0173-1#01-ADN177#005) and are compatible with a request or constraints asking for drills for mineral material.

==== Matching Algorithm for References

Clause 4.4.1 has discussed matching strategies for semantic identifiers. This clause explains matching strategies based on the reference concept (see Clause 5.3.10) in more detail and covers other kinds of identifying elements.

For example, the string serialization of references as defined in Clause 7.2.3 is used for easier understanding.

Exact matching of two references

* An external reference A matches an external reference B if all values of all keys are identical.


====
Note: it is unlikely that a fragment value is identical to a global reference value; it will reference something different.
====


A model reference A matches a model reference B if all values of all keys are identical. +

====
Note: the key type can be ignored since the fragment keys are always unique (e.g. all idShorts of submodel elements in a submodel or all submodel elements in a submodel element list or collection).
====


* An external reference A matches a model reference B and vice versa if all values of all keys are identical.


====
Note: since identifiables of the Asset Administration Shell are globally unique, model references are special cases of global references. The only difference is the handling of key types that are predefined for Asset Administration Shell elements. Other key types could be predefined, e.g. for IRDI paths etc. However, so far only generic key types are supported.
====



====
Note: if the key types are not identical although all key values follow the correct order of the key chain, then at least one of the references is buggy and a warning should be issued.
====


The definition of link:https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#terminology[XML Schema] is used for matching

* "(Of string or names:) Two strings or names being compared must be identical.
* Characters with multiple possible representations in ISO/IEC 10646 (e.g. characters with both precomposed and base+diacritic forms) match only if they have the same representation in both strings.
* No case folding is performed.
* (Of strings and rules in the grammar:) A string matches a grammatical production if it belongs to the language generated by that production."

[.underline]#Examples for matching model references:#

Although these two model references would match according to the matching rules, other rules are violated, i.e. that the ID of the submodel is unique. If the ID of a submodel is unique, it is not possible that there are two direct submodel element children with the same name (here: Specification). It is also not possible two different versions of the same submodel are compared here, because we would then assume that the ID also contains the version information (see Clause 5.3.2.2). The matching algorithm would still identify these two model references as matching although one of them is buggy.

=== Submodel Instances and Templates

==== Can New or Proprietary Submodels be Formed?

It is in the interest of Industry 4.0 for as many submodels as possible, including free and proprietary submodels, to be formed (see link:#bib4[[4\]], "Free property sets"). A submodel can be formed at any time for a specific Administration Shell of an asset. The provider of the Administration Shell can form in-house identifiers for the type and instance of the submodel in line with Clause 4.3. All I4.0 systems are called on to ignore submodels and properties that are not individually known. Hence, it is always possible to deposit proprietary – e.g. manufacturer-specific or user-specific – information, submodels, or properties in an Administration Shell.


====
Note: it is the intention of the Administration Shell to include proprietary information, e.g. to link to company-wide identification schemes or information required for company-wide data processing. This way, a single infrastructure can be used to transport standardized and proprietary information at the same time. New information elements can also be conveyed and introduced (and standardized at a later stage).
====


==== Creating a Submodel Instance Based on an Existing Submodel Template

A public specification of a submodel template (e.g. via publication by Plattform Industrie 4.0) should be available to instantiate an existing submodel template. In special cases, a submodel can also be instantiated from a non-public submodel template, such as a manufacturer specification.

In November 2020, the first two submodel templates for the Asset Administration Shell were published, one for a nameplate link:#bib40[[40\]] and one for generic technical data link:#bib39[[39\]]. Others followed and will follow. Please see link:#bib45[[45\]] for an overview of registered submodel templates.

The identifiers of concept definitions to be used as semantic references are already predefined in each submodel template. An instantiation of such a submodel merely requires the creation of properties with a semantic reference to the property definition and an attached value. The same applies to other subtypes of submodel elements.

The only thing that cannot be defined in the template itself is the unique ID of the submodel instance itself (it is not identical to the ID of the submodel template), as well as the property values, etc. Templates also define cardinalities, for example whether an element is optional or not. Submodel element lists typically contain more than one element: the template contains an exemplary element template; the other elements can be created by copy/paste from this template.

=== Events

====  Overview

Events are a very versatile mechanism of the Asset Administration Shell. The following subclauses describe some use cases for events. They summarize different types of events to depict requirements, introduce a _SubmodelElement_ “_Event_" to enable declaration of events of an Asset Administration Shell. Further, the general format of event messages is specified.


====
Note: the concept of event is still in the experimental phase. Please be aware that backward compatibility cannot be ensured for future versions of the metamodel.
====


====  Brief Use Cases for Events Used in Asset Administration Shells

* Event use cases are briefly outlined in the following (see also ):

image::image8.jpeg[]

* An integrator has purchased a device. Later in time, the supplier of the device provides a new firmware. The integrator wants to detect the offer of a new firmware and wants to update the firmware after evaluating its suitability ("forward events"). A dependent Asset Administration Shell ("D4") detects events from a parent or type Asset Administration Shell ("D1"), which is described by the _derivedFrom_ relation. An illustration of the use case is given in Figure 7.
* An integrator/operator operates a motor purchased from a supplier. During operation, condition monitoring incidents occur. Both parties agree on a business model providing availability. The supplier wants to monitor device statuses which are located further in the value chain ("reverse events"). An illustration of the use case is given in Figure 7.

.Forward and Reverse Events
image::image8.jpeg[]

* An operator is operating a certain I4.0 component over time. Changes that occasionally occur to these I4.0 components from different systems shall be tracked for documentation and auditing purposes. This can be achieved by recording events over time. An illustration of the use case is given in Figure 8.

.Tracking of Changes via Events
image::image9.jpeg[]

* An operator is operating different I4.0 components, which are deployed to manufacturer clouds. The operator wants to integrate data from these components, according to DIN SPEC 92222. For this purpose, information needs to be forwarded to the operator cloud ("value push"). An illustration of the use case is given in Figure 9.

.Value Push Events Across Clouds
image::image10.jpeg[]

====  Input and Output Directions of Events

We can distinguish between incoming and outgoing events. See Table 3 for more information on the event directions.

.Directions of Events
[cols="32%,68%",options="header",]
|===
|*Direction* |*Description*
|Out |The event is monitoring the _Referable_ it is attached to. An outer message infrastructure, e.g. by OPC UA, MQTT or AMQP, will transport these events to other Asset Administration Shells, further outer systems and users.
|In |The software entity, which implements the respective _Referable_, can handle incoming events. These incoming events will be delivered by an outer message infrastructure, e.g. OPC UA, MQTT or AMQP, to the software entity of the _Referable_.
|===

==== Types of Events

The uses cases described in Clause 4.6.2 need different types of events. Each event type is identified by a _semanticId_ and features a specialized payload.

Table 4 gives an overview of types of events. The possible directions of an event are described in Clause 4.6.3.

.Types of Events
[cols="26%,12%,62%",options="header",]

|Security events |Out a|
* logging events
* access violations, unfitting roles and rights, denial of service, etc.

|Alarms and events |Out a|
* alarms and events management analog to distributed control systems (DCS)

|===

*Custom Event Types*

Custom event types can be defined by using a proprietary, but worldwide unique, semanticId for this event type. Such customized events can be sent or received by the software entity of the respective referable, based on arbitrary conditions, triggers, or behavior. While the general format of the event messages needs to comply with this specification, the payload might be completely customized.

*Event Scopes*

Events can be stated with an _observableReference_ to the _Referables_ of Asset Administration Shell, __Submodel__s, and _SubmodelElements._ These _Referables_ define the scope of the events, which are to be received or sent. +
Table 5 describes the different scopes of an event.

== The Information Metamodel of the Asset Administration Shell (normative)

=== Introduction

This clause specifies the information metamodel of the Asset Administration Shell.

An overview of the metamodel of the Asset Administration Shell is given in Subclause 5.1; Subclause 5.3 describes the classes and all their attributes in detail.

The legend of the UML diagrams and the table specification of the classes is explained in Annex D and Annex E. Readers familiar with UML may skip the first clause in Annex E. It is however recommended to have a look at the specifics used in this modelling, especially those on dealing with model references.


====
Note: an xmi representation of the UML model can be found in the repository "aas-specs" in the github project admin-shell-io *link:#bib51[[51\]]*: https://github.com/admin-shell-io/aas-specs/tree/master/schemas/xmi
====


=== Overview Metamodel of the Asset Administration Shell

This clause gives an overview of the main classes of the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) metamodel.

Figure 10 shows the main classes to describe a single Asset Administration Shell.

An Asset Administration Shell represents exactly one asset (_AssetAdministrationShell/assetInformation_). Type assets and instance assets are distinguished by the attribute "_AssetInformation/assetKind_". See Clause 5.3.4 for details.


====
Note: the UML modelling uses so-called abstract classes for denoting reused concepts like "HasSemantics", "Qualifiable" etc.

In case of an Asset Administration Shell of an instance asset, a reference to the Asset Administration Shell representing the corresponding type asset or another instance asset it was derived from may be added (_AssetAdministrationShell/derivedFrom_). The same holds true for the Asset Administration Shell of an type asset. Types can also be derived from other types.

.Overview Metamodel of the Asset Administration Shell
image::image11.png[]

An asset may typically be represented by several different identification properties like the serial number, the manufacturer part ID or the different customer part IDs, its RFID code, etc. Such external identifiers are defined as specific asset IDs, each characterized by a user-defined name, a value, and the user domain (tenant, subject in Attribute Based Access Control; _AssetInformation/specificAssetId_). See Clause 5.3.4 for details. Additionally, a global asset identifier should be assigned to the asset (_AssetInformation/globalAssetId_) in the production and operation phase.

Asset Administration Shells, submodels and concept descriptions need to be globally uniquely identifiable (_Identifiable_). Other elements like properties only need to be referable within the model and thus only require a local identifier (_idShort_ from _Referable_). For details on identification, see Clause 4.3; details on _Identifiable_ and _Referable_ are provided in Clause 5.3.2.7 and Clause 5.3.2.10.

__Submodel__s consist of a set of submodel elements. Submodel elements may be qualified by a so-called _Qualifier_. There might be more than one qualifier per _Qualifiable_. See Clause 5.3.2.8 and Clause 5.3.2.9 for details.

There are different subtypes of submodel elements like properties, operations, lists, etc. See Clause 5.3.7 for details. A typical submodel element is shown in the overview figure: a property is a data element that has a value of simple type like string, date, etc. Every data element is a submodel element (not visible in the figure but implicitly the case, since _DataElement_ is inheriting from _SubmodelElement_). For details on properties, see Clause 5.3.7.12.

Every submodel element needs a semantic definition _(semanticId_ in _HasSemantics_) to have a well-defined meaning. The submodel element might either refer directly to a corresponding semantic definition provided by an external reference (e.g. to an ECLASS or IEC CDD property definition) or it may indirectly reference a concept description (_ConceptDescription_). See Clause 4.4.1 for matching strategies, and Clause 5.3.2.6 for details.

A concept description may be derived from another property definition of an external standard or another concept description (_ConceptDescription/isCaseOf_). _isCaseOf_ is a more formal definition of _sourceOfDefinition_, which is just text.


====
Note: in this case, most of the attributes are redundant because they are defined in the external standard. Attributes for information like _preferredName_, _unit_ etc. are added to increase usability. Consistency w.r.t. the referenced submodel element definitions should be ensured by corresponding tooling.
====


If a concept description is not just a copy or refinement of an external standard, the provider of the Asset Administration Shell using this concept description shall be aware that an interoperability with other Asset Administration Shells cannot be ensured.

Data specification templates (_DataSpecification_) can be used to define a named set of additional attributes (besides those predefined by the metamodel) for an element. The data specification template following IEC 61360 is typically used for the concept description of properties, providing e.g. an attribute "preferredName". The _\<<template>>_ dependency is used to denote recommended data specification templates. See Clause 5.3.2.2 for details.

Data specification templates like the template for IEC 61360 property definitions (Part 3a) are explicitly predefined and recommended to be used by Plattform Industrie 4.0. See Clause 6 for details. If proprietary templates are used, interoperability with other Asset Administration Shells cannot be ensured.

Besides submodel elements including properties and concept descriptions, other identifiable elements may also use additional templates (_HasDataSpecification_). Data specification templates are selected at design time. Further details are provided in Clause 6.

Figure 12 gives a complete overview of all elements defined in the metamodel and specified in Clause 5.3. The UML packages reflect the structure of Clause 5.3. The elements of package "Core" are specified as first class citizens in Clause 5.3, except for their imported packages: the elements of package "SubmodelElements" are specified in Clause 5.3.6. Elements of package "Common" are specified in Clause 5.3.2. The elements of package "Reference" are specified in Clause 5.3.10. Elements from package "Types" are specified in Clause 5.3.11. The only package that is not listed is "Data Specifications (Templates)" because data specifications are handled differently. Data specification templates are explained in Clause 6.


====
Note: the abstract classes are numbered h0_, h1_, etc. (e.g. h1_Referable); their aliases however are defined without this prefix. The reason for this naming is that no order for inherited classes can be defined in the tooling used for UML modelling (Enterprise Architect), since they are ordered alphabetically. The order is important for some serializations (e.g. for XML).
====


Figure 11 shows the so-called environment. The environment’s purpose is to list all Asset Administration Shells, all submodels, and all concept descriptions – in other word, all identifiables within an ecosystem.

=== Metamodel Specification Details: Designators

==== General

This clause specifies the classes of the metamodel in detail. An overview is provided in Clause 5.2. Annex E explains UML modelling together with the specifics used in this specification. Annex D depicts the templates used to describe the classes and relationships. Annex G shows some of the diagrams together with all their inherited attributes to give a complete overview.

To understand the specifications, it is crucial to understand the common attributes first (Clause 5.3.2). They are reused throughout the specifications of the other classes ("inherits from") and define important concepts like identifiable, qualifiable, etc. They are abstract, i.e. there is no object instance of such classes.

The concept of referencing and how a reference is represented in the UML diagrams and the tables is explained in Clause 5.3.9 and Annex E.

Constraints that are no invariants of classes are specified in Clause 5.3.11.3.

==== Common Attributes

===== General

This clause specifies the abstract classes that represent commonly used attributes and terminology, together with the classes and data types exclusively used in these classes. They are represented in alphabetical order.

===== Administrative Information Attributes

.Metamodel of Administrative Information
image::image14.png[]

Every identifiable may contain administrative information. Administrative information includes, for example,

* information about the version of the element,
* information about who created or who made the last change to the element,
* information about the languages available in case the element contains text; the master or default language may also be defined for translating purposes,
* information about the submodel template that guides the creation of the submodel

In principle, the version corresponds to the _version_identifier_ according to IEC 62832. However, it is not used for concept identifiers only (IEC TS 62832-1), but for all identifiable elements. Together, version and revision correspond to the version number according to IEC 62832.

Other attributes of the administrative information like creator refer to ISO 15836-1:2017, the Dublin Core metadata element set.

For more information on the concept of subject, see Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) link:#bib49[[49\]]. The assumption is that every subject has a unique identifier.

_AdministrativeInformation_ allows the usage of templates (_HasDataSpecification_). Data specifications are defined in separate documents.


====
Note 1: two submodels with the same semanticId but different administrative information shall have different IDs (_Submodel/id_), since they denote that the submodel is not backward compatible or has some other major administrative changes. The _idShort_ typically does not change. The same applies to other identifiables (_Identifiable/id_). Otherwise, the ID of a submodel would not be sufficient to identify the data or service provided by the submodel.
====



====
Note 2: since submodels with different versions shall have different identifiers, it is possible that an Asset Administration Shell has two submodels with the same _semanticId_ but different versions, i.e. different administrative metainformation.
====



====
Note 3: some of the administrative information like the version number might need to be part of the identification. This is similar to the handling of identifiers for concept descriptions using IRDIs. In ECLASS, the IRDI 0173-1#02-AO677#002 contains the version information #002.
====



====
Note 4: the process of versioning or adding other administrative information to elements is done by external version or configuration management software and not by the Asset Administration Shell itself.

===== Identifiable Attributes

.Metamodel of Identifiables

An identifiable element is a referable with a globally unique identifier (_Identifier_). Only the global ID (_Identifiable/id_) shall be used to reference an identifiable, because the _idShort_ is not unique for an identifiable. Identifiables may have administrative information like version, etc.

Non-identifiable referable elements can be referenced. However, this requires the context of the element. A referable that is not identifiable has a short identifier (_idShort_) that is unique just in its context, its name space.

Information about identification can be found in Clause 4.3. See Clause 4.3.4 for constraints and recommendations on when to use which type of identifier.

Example of a _ValueQualifier_: property "temperature" and qualifier "value quality" with different qualifier values like "measured", "substitute value".

Example of a _ConceptQualifier:_ an Asset Administration Shell with two submodels with different IDs but the same semanticId = "Bill of Material". The qualifier could denote the life cycle with qualifier values like "as planned", "as maintained" etc. (see +
Figure 21).

Example of a _TemplateQualifier:_ a submodel element with qualifier value "mandatory" or "optional". This qualification is needed to build a correct submodel instance. For more information see link:#bib48[[48\]].

===== Referable Attributes

.Metamodel of Referables
image::image23.png[]

The metamodel differentiates between elements that are identifiable, referable, or none of both. The latter means they are neither inheriting from _Referable_ nor from _Identifiable_, which applies e.g. to __Qualifier__s.

Referable elements can be referenced via the _idShort_. For details on referencing, see Clause 5.3.9.

Not every element of the metamodel is referable. There are elements that are just attributes of a referable.

The __idShort__ shall be unique in its name space for non-identifiable referables (see Constraint AASd-022). A name space is defined as follows in this context: the parent element(s), which an element is part of and that is either referable or identifiable, is the name space of the element. Examples: a submodel is the name space for the properties directly contained in it; the name space of a submodel element contained in a submodel element collection is the submodel element collection.

In _AssetInformation,_ identifying meta data of the asset that is represented by an Asset Administration Shell is defined.

The asset may either represent a type asset or an instance asset.

The asset has a globally unique identifier, plus – if needed – additional domain-specific (proprietary) identifiers. However, to support the corner case of very first phase of life cycle where a stabilized/constant global asset identifier does not already exist, the corresponding attribute "globalAssetId" is optional.

Note 2: semanticIds for the single specificAssetIds do not need to be unique.

For more information on the concept of subject, see Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) link:#bib49[[49\]]. The assumption is that every subject has a unique identifier.

==== Submodel Attributes

.Metamodel of Submodel
image::image26.png[]

Adding a _semanticId_ for a submodel is recommended (see Table 2).

If the submodel is of _kind=Template_ (modelling kind as inherited by _HasKind_), the submodel elements within the submodel are presenting submodel element templates. If the submodel is of _kind=Instance_, its submodel elements represent submodel element instances.


====
Note: validators shall handle a submodel like _SubmodelElementCollection/submodelElements_ and not like a _SubmodelElementList/value_. The difference is that a submodel is identifiable and a predefined unit of information within the Asset Administration Shell.

|Class: |[[Submodel]]Submodel
|Explanation: a|
A submodel defines a specific aspect of the asset represented by the Asset Administration Shell.

A submodel is used to structure the digital representation and technical functionality of an Administration Shell into distinguishable parts. Each submodel refers to a well-defined domain or subject matter. Submodels can become standardized and, in turn, submodel templates.

==== Submodel Element Attributes

.Metamodel of Submodel Element
image::image27.png[]

Submodel elements are qualifiable elements, i.e. one or more qualifiers may be defined for each of them.

It is recommended to add a _semanticId_ to a _SubmodelElement._

Submodel elements may also have defined data specification templates. A template might be defined to mirror some of the attributes like _preferredName_ and _unit_ of a property concept definition if there is no corresponding concept description available. Otherwise, there is only the property definition referenced by _semanticId_ available for the property; the attributes must be looked up online in a different way and are not available offline.

==== Overview of Submodel Element Types

.Metamodel Overview for Submodel Element Subtypes

Submodel elements include data properties as well as operations, events and other elements needed to describe a model for an asset (see Figure 27).

===== General

All submodel elements including abstract classes like data elements are specified in alphabetical order.

===== Annotated Relationship Element Attributes

.Metamodel of Annotated Relationship Elements
image::image29.png[]

An annotated relationship is a relationship similar to a ternary association in UML. The semantics of the relationship is defined via the _semanticId_ of the _RelationshipElement_. If this semantic definition requires additional information not contained in the _first_ or _second_ object referenced via the relationship, this information needs to be stored as annotation.

===== Submodel Element Collection Attributes

.Metamodel of Submodel Element Collections
image::image44.png[]

Submodel Element Collections are used for complex elements with a typically fixed set of properties with unique names. This set of properties is typically predefined by the semantic definition (referenced via _semanticId_) of the submodel element collection. Each property within the collection itself should have clearly defined semantics.


====
Note: the different elements of a submodel element collection do not have to have different __semanticId__s. However, in these cases the usage of a _SubmodelElementList_ should be considered.
====


Example: a single document has a predefined set of properties like title, version, author, etc. They logically belong to a document. So a single document is represented by a _SubmodelElementCollection_. An asset usually has many different documents available like operating instructions, safety instructions, etc. The set of all documents is represented by a _SubmodelElementList_ (see Clause _5.3.7.17)_. In this case, we have a _SubmodelElementList_ of __SubmodelElementCollection__s.


====
Note: the elements within a submodel element collection are not ordered. Every element has a unique ID (its "idShort"). However, it is recommended to adhere to the order defined in the submodel template.

===== Submodel Element List Attributes

.Metamodel of Submodel Element Lists
image::image45.png[]

Submodel element lists are used for sets (i.e. unordered collections without duplicates), ordered lists (i.e. ordered collections that may contain duplicates), bags (i.e. unordered collections that may contain duplicates), and ordered sets (i.e. ordered collections without duplicates).


====
Note: there is no _idShort_ for submodel elements in lists (see Constraint AASd-120).
====


Submodel element lists are also used to create multi-dimensional arrays. A two-dimensional array listlink:#bib3[[3\]]link:#bib5[[5\]] with _Property_ values would be realized like follows: the first submodel element list would contain three _SubmodelElementList_ elements. Each of these three _SubmodelElementLists_ would contain 5 single _Property_ elements. The _semanticId_ of the contained properties would be the same for all lists in the first list, i.e. _semanticIdListElement_ would be identical for all three lists contained in the first list. The _semanticId_ of the three contained lists would differ depending on the dimension it represents. In case of complex values in the array, a _SubmodelElementCollection_ would be used as values in the leaf lists.

Similarly, a table with three columns can be represented. In this case a _SubmodelElementCollection_ with three _SubmodelElementLists_ would be contained and the _semanticId_ as well as the _semanticIdListElement_ for the three columns would differ.

Matching strategies for semantic IDs are explained in Clause 4.4.1.

To date, two kinds of references are distinguished: references to external objects or entities (external reference) and references to model elements of the same or another Asset Administration Shell (model reference). Model references are also used for metamodel inherent relationships like submodels of an Asset Administration Shell (notation see Annex A).

An external reference is a unique identifier. The identifier can be a concatenation of different identifiers, representing e.g. an IRDI path.


====
Note: references should not be mixed up with locators. Even URLs can be used as identifiers and do not necessarily describe a resource that can be accessed.

|Class: |[[Reference]]Reference
|Explanation: a|
Reference to either a model element of the same or another Asset Administration Shell or to an external entity

A model reference is an ordered list of keys, each key referencing an element. The complete list of keys may, for example, be concatenated to a path that gives unique access to an element.

An external reference is a reference to an external entity.

Expected semantic ID of the referenced model element (_Reference/type=ModelReference_); there typically is no semantic ID for for the referenced object of external references _(Reference/type=ExternalReference)_.


====
Note 1: if Reference/referredSemanticId is defined, the semanticId of the model element referenced should have a matching semantic ID. If this is not the case, a validator should raise a warning.
====



====
Note 2: it is recommended to use an external reference for the semantic ID expected from the referenced model element.

===== Key Attributes

.Metamodel of Keys
image::image49.png[]

Keys are used to define references (_Reference_).

Figure 49 presents a logical model of key types. These logical enumerations are used to formulate constraints.

|Attribute |Explanation |Type |Card.
|type a|
Denotes which kind of entity is referenced

If _Key/type = GlobalReference,_ the key represents a reference to a source that can be globally identified.

If _Key/type = FragmentReference,_ the key represents a bookmark or a similar local identifier within its parent element as specified by the key that precedes this key.

In all other cases, the key references a model element of the same or another Asset Administration Shell. The name of the model element is explicitly listed.

An example for using a _FragmentId_ as type of a key is a reference to an element within a file that is part of an Asset Administration Shell aasx package.

The difference is that more than one document is allowed in the first submodels and thus a submodel element list is defined: elements in a list are numbered. However, it is also possible to define a display name in this case. The display name of the SubmodelElementCollection should be the same in both bases, e.g. "Users Manual".

==== Primitive and Simple Data Types

===== Predefined Simple Data Types

The metamodel of the Asset Administration Shell uses basic data types as defined in the link:https://www.w3.org/XML/Core/[XML Schema Definition] (XSD)footnote:[https://www.w3.org/XML/Core/, former https://www.w3.org/XML/Schema]. See Table 7 for an overview of the used types. Their definition is outside the scope of this document.

The meaning and format of xsd types is specified in https://www.w3.org/XML/Schema. The simple type "langString" is specified in the Resource Description Framework (RDF)footnote:[see: https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/].

See Clause 5.3.12.6 for constraints on types.

===== Enumeration for Submodel Element Value Types

Enumerations are primitive data types. Most of the enumerations are defined in the context of their class. This clause defines enumerations for submodel element value typesfootnote:[E.g. Property/valueType].

The predefined types used to define the type of values of properties and other values use the names and the semantics of XML Schema Definition (XSD)footnote:[see https://www.w3.org/XML/Schema, https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#built-in-primitive-datatypes]. Additionally, the type "langString" with the semantics as defined in the Resource Description Framework (RDF)footnote:[see: https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/] is used. "langString" is a string value tagged with a language code.


====
Note 1: RDFfootnote:[See https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#xsd-datatypes] recommends to not use the following xsd data types. That is why they are excluded from the allowed data types.
====


* XSD BuildIn List types are not supported (ENTITIES, IDREFS and NMTOKENS).
* XSD string BuildIn types are not supported (normalizedString, token, language, NCName, ENTITY, ID, IDREF).
* The following XSD primitive types are not supported: NOTATION, QName.


====
Note 2: the following RDF types are not supported: HTML and XMLLiteral.

====  Constraints: Global Invariants

===== Introduction

This clause documents constraints that represent global invariants, i.e. constraints that cannot be assigned to a single class.

In contrast, a class invariant is a constraint that must be true for all instances of a class at any time. They are documented as part of the class specification.

===== Constraints for Referables and Identifiables

{aasd117}


====
Note: in other words (AASd-117), __idShort__ is mandatory for all __Referable__s except for referables being direct childs of __SubmodelElementList__s and for all __Identifiable__s.
====


{aasd120}

{aasd022}


====
Note: AASd-022 also means that __idShort__s of referables shall be matched sensitive to the case.

===== Constraints for Asset-Related Information

{aasd116}


====
Note: AASd-116 is important to enable a generic search across global and specific asset IDs.
====


===== Constraints for Types

{aasd130}

Constraint AASd-130 ensures that encoding and interoperability between different serializations is possible. It corresponds to the restrictions as defined for the XML Schema 1.0footnote:[https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#charsets].

== Data Specification Templates (normative)

=== Introduction

A data specification template specifies which additional attributes, which are not part of the metamodel, shall be added to an element instance. Typically, data specification templates have a specific scope. For example, templates for concept descriptions differ from templates for operations, etc. More than one data specification template can be defined and used for an element instance. _HasDataSpecification_ defines, which templates are used for an element instance.

Figure 55 shows the concept of data specification for a predefined data specification conformant to IEC61360footnote:[Since the data specification templates are specified and maintained in separate documents, these templates are considered as examples only, although there is a similarity to existing data specifications.] that, for example, can be used for concept descriptions for single properties.

.Core Elements of Using Data Specifications (non-normative)
image::image56.png[]

The template introduced to describe the concept of a property, a value list, or a value is based on IEC 61360. Figure 55 also shows how concept descriptions and the predefined data specification templates are related to each other.

==== Data Specification Template Attributes

.Data Specification Templates
image::image57.png[]


====
Note: the data specification templates do not belong to the metamodel of the Asset Administration Shell. In serializations that choose specific templates, the corresponding data specification content may be directly incorporated.
====


It is required that a data specification template has a global unique ID so that it can be referenced via _HasDataSpecification/dataSpecification_.

A template consists of the _DataSpecificationContent_ containing the additional attributes to be added to the element instance that references the data specification template, as well as meta information about the template itself. These are two separate classes in UML.

== Mappings to Data Formats to Share I4.0-Compliant Information (normative)

=== General

It is crucial for Industry 4.0 applications to share information between different systems throughout the areas covered by the entire RAMI4.0 model link:#bib1[[1\]] link:#bib2[[2\]]. OPC UA is a frequently used format for information models in the domain of production operations, but there is a need for other formats for further areas and the relationships between them.

This document specifies the Asset Administration Shell in a technology-neutral format, UML. Different data formats are used or recommended to be used in the different life cycle phases of a productfootnote:[The word “data formats” is used as shortcut and includes the use of conceptual advantages such as information models, schemes, transmission protocols, etc.]. Serializations and mappings of the Asset Administration Shell are provided to cover the complete life cycle of each of these formats. Figure 57.

Table 10 explains the main purpose of each of the formats: OPC UA information modelsfootnote:[OPC UA Information Models should not be mixed up with the Client/Server or Pub/Sub Protocol of OPC UA. This would belong to the communication but not to the Asset Administration Shell representation layer.], AutomationML, XML, JSON, and RDF. The different purposes are visualized in Figure 57.

===  General Rules

====  Introduction

There are some general rules that apply to all serializations or can be used in different serializations.

====  Encoding

Blobs require the following encoding: base64 string.

====  Serialization of Values of Type "Reference"

Some mappings or serializations convert the type "Reference" into a single string. In this case, the following serialization is required:

[.underline]#Grammar:#

____
*<Reference> ::= ["[" <ReferenceType> [ "- " <referredSemanticId> " -" ] "]" ] <Key> \{(", " <Key> }**

*<ReferenceType> ::= "ExternalRef" | "ModelRef" value of AAS:Reference/type*

*<SemanticId> ::= ["[" <ReferenceType> "]"] <Key> \{(", " <Key> }** +
*value of AAS:Reference/referredSemanticId*

*<Key> ::= "(" <KeyType> ")" <KeyValue>*

*<KeyType> ::= value of AAS:Key/type*

*<KeyValue> ::= value of AAS:Key/value*
____


====
Note 1: an IRI may also contain special symbols like "(", "," and "[". A blank is added before the new key or value to distinguish beginning and end of a new key.
====



====
Note 2: _ReferenceType_ is optional. It is clear from the first key in the key chain whether the reference is a global or a model reference. The examples in this document therefore do not use this prefix.
====


[.underline]#Valid Examples:#

[.underline]#References#:

____
*(GlobalReference)0173-1#02-BAA120#008*

*[ExternalRef](GlobalReference)0173-1#02-BAA120#008*

*(Submodel)https://example.com/aas/1/1/1234859590, (SubmodelElementList)Documents, (SubmodelElementCollection)0, (MultiLanguageProperty)Title*
____

[.underline]#Model References:#
____
*(ConceptDescription)0173-1#02-BAA120#008*

*[ModelRef](ConceptDescription)0173-1#02-BAA120#008*

*(Submodel)https://example.com/aas/1/1/1234859590, (Property)Temperature*

*[ModelRef- (ConceptDescription)0173-1#02-BAA120#008*

*-](Submodel)https://example.com/aas/1/1/1234859590*
____

====  Semantic Identifiers for Metamodel and Data Specifications

Rules for creating identifiers are defined to enable the unique identification of concepts as used and defined in the metamodel of the Asset Administration Shell.

The following grammar is used to create valid identifiers:

____
*<Namespace> ::= <AAS Namespace> | <Data Specification Namespace>*

*<Namespace Qualifier> ::= <AAS Namespace Qualifier> | <Data Specification Qualifier>*

*<AAS Namespace> ::= <Shell-Namespace> "/aas/" <Version>*

*<Data Specification Namespace> ::= <Shell-Namespace> "/DataSpecifications/" <idShort of Data Specification> <Version>*

*<Shell-Namespace> ::= "https://admin-shell.io/"*

*<Version> ::= \{<Digit>}+ "/" \{<Digit>}+ [ "/" \{<Character>}+ ]*

*<Digit> ::= "0"| "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9"*

*<Character> ::= characters conformant to regular expression [a..zA..Z-]*
____

Up to this point, two data specification templates are defined. Now we need to define which data specification namespace is to be used for every data specification.

____
*<AAS Namespace Qualifier> ::= "AAS:"*

*<Data Specification Qualifier> ::= defined per Data Specification*
____

A concrete unique identifier is defined as follows:

____
*<AAS Unique Concept Identifier> ::= (<Namespace> | <Namespace Qualifier>) "/" <AAS Concept Identifier>*

*<AAS Concept Identifier> ::= <AAS Class Name> [( <AAS Attribute> | <AAS Enumeration >)]*

*<AAS Attribute> ::= "/" <AAS Attribute Name> [\{ "/" <AAS Attribute Name>}* ]*

*<AAS Enumeration> ::= [\{ "/" <AAS Attribute Name>}*] "/" <AAS Enumeration Value>*
____

[.underline]#Examples for valid unique Asset Administration Shell concept identifiers:#

____
*https://admin-shell.io/aas/2/0/AssetAdministrationShell/administration/version*

*AAS:AssetAdministrationShell/administration/version*

*AAS:AssetInformation/assetKind/Instance*
____

The application of the pattern is explained as follows:

The concept identifier of a Class follows the pattern

____
_<_*AAS Class name>*
____

This also applies to abstract classes and types including enumerations.

[.underline]#Valid examples:#
____

*AAS:Submodel*

*AAS:Qualifier*

*AAS:Reference*

*AAS:ContentType*

*AAS:KeyTypes*
____

Attributes of classes are separated by "/". Inherited attributes can also be referenced in this way, if the concrete referable is important in the context.

Basic Pattern:

____
*<AAS Class name>"/"<AAS Attribute Name>*
____

Examplesfootnote:[For simplicity reasons, most examples use the namespace qualifier and not the full path of the namespace.]:

____

*AAS:Referable/idShort*

*AAS:Property/idShort*

*AAS:Qualifier/semanticId*
____

This also applies to attributes of attributes, if the cardinality of the attributes involved is not greater than 1:
____

*<AAS Class Name> "/" <AAS Attribute Name> [\{ "/" <AAS Attribute Name>}* ]*
____

[.underline]#Valid examples:#
____

*AAS:Identifiable/administration/version*
____

This also applies to values of enumerations:
____

*<AAS Class Name>[\{ "/" <AAS Attribute Name>}*][ "/" <AAS Enumeration Value>]*
____

[.underline]#Valid examples:#
____

*AAS:Key/type/Submodel*

*AAS:AasSubmodelElements/Submodel*
____

In case of an attribute with a cardinality greater than 1, no further attributes or enumeration values can be added.


====
Note: although the attribute name in UML is always singular, the attribute name is annotated by the plural "s" if the cardinality is > 1.
====


[.underline]#Valid examples#:
____

*AAS:Operation/InputVariables*

*AAS:AssetAdministrationShell/submodels*

*AAS:Submodel/submodelElements*
____

_[.underline]#Invalid examples:#_

____
*AAS:AssetAdministrationShell/submodels/administration/version*

*AAS:Submodel/Property/idShort*
____

These semantic identifiers are used as values for the _RefSemantic_ attribute in AutomationML Mapping of the Asset Administration Shell. They are also used in OPC UA to describe the semantics of the metamodel via the OPC UA _HasDictionaryEntry_ reference type.

Additional identifiers might be needed for specific serializations and mappings, e.g. for a set of Asset Administration Shells or a set of available concept descriptions. Here, the Asset Administration Shell metamodel and specification does not give any recommendations.

Data specification handling is special. Data specification templates do not belong to Part 1 of the Asset Administration Shell. However, serializations only support the predefined data specification templates as stipulated in this specification series, Part 3. Their corresponding name space qualifiers are defined individually.

[.underline]#Examples:#

In xml and JSON, data specifications are embedded into the schema itself using the attribute "embeddedDataSpecification". Here, no concept identifier shall be used. For example,
____

*AAS:ConceptDescription/embeddedDataSpecifications*
____

is not a valid concept identifier. _AAS:DataSpecificationContent_ is a valid concept identifier.

====  Embedded Data Specifications

This specification predefines data specifications that can be used within an Asset Administration Shell to ensure interoperability.

Consequently, some serializations or mappings support exactly the data descriptions defined in this specification, although the metamodel as such is more flexible and would also support proprietary data specifications.

In the case of restricted use of data specifications, we speak of "embedded data specifications". Figure 58 explains the realization: instead of a set of external global references to externally defined data specifications, a set of pairs consisting of an external global reference to a data specification and the data specification content itself are directly "embedded". Here, the data specification content belongs to the schema, while the data specification including its content are not part of the schema in the general concept. This is similar to the concept of _semanticIds_: either it is an external global reference to an external concept dictionary, or it is a reference to a concept description within the schema. However, there is only one reference allowed for _semanticId_, whereas a set of data specification references is permitted for data specifications.

.Realization of Embedded Data Specifications

===  XML

The metamodel of an Asset Administration Shell needs to be serialized for import and export scenarios. XML is a possible serialization format.

eXtensible Markup Language (XMLfootnote:[see: https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/]) is very well suited to derive information from an IT system, e.g. to process it manually and then feed it into another IT system. It meets the needs of the information sharing scenario defined in the leading picture in Clause 4.1. XML provides the possibilities of scheme definitions, which can be used to syntactically validate the represented information in each step.

JSONfootnote:[see: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259 or https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-404.htm] (JavaScript Object Notation) is a further serialization format that serializes the metamodel of an Asset Administration Shell for import and export scenarios.

Additionally, JSON format is used to describe the payload in the http/REST API for active Asset Administration Shells link:#bib37[[37\]].

===  RDF

The Resource Description Framework (RDF) link:#bib32[[32\]] is the recommended standard of the W3C to unambiguously model and present semantic data. RDF documents are structured in the form of triples, consisting of subjects, relations, and objects. The resulting model is often interpreted as a graph, with the subject and object elements as the nodes and the relations as the graph edges.

RDF is closely related to web standards, illustrated by the fact that all elements are encoded using (HTTP-)IRIs. As a common practice, the provision of additional information at the referenced location of an RDF entity directly allows the interlinking of entitiesfootnote:[Note: entity as a generic term and entity as a specific submodel element subtype need tobe distinugished.] based on the web. This process – following links in order to discover related information – is called dereferencing a resource and is supported by any browser or web client. Connecting distributed data sources through the web in the described manner is referred to by the term “Linked Data”. Connecting the available resources and capabilities of linked data with the expressiveness of the Asset Administration Shell is one motivation for the RDF serialization.

In addition, RDF is the basis of a wide range of logical inference and reasoning techniques. Vocabularies like RDF Schema (RDFS) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL) combine the graph-based syntax of RDF with formal definitions and axioms. This allows automated reasoners to understand the relation between entities to some extent and draw conclusions.

Combining both features, the RDF mapping of the Asset Administration Shell can provide the basis for complex queries and requests. SPARQL, the standard query language for the Semantic Web, can combine reasoning features with the integration of external data sources. In order to benefit of these abilities, the Asset Administration Shell requires a clear scheme of its RDF representation.

AutomationML (IEC 62714) is especially suited for serializing the import and export scenarios of the metamodel of an Asset Administration Shell in the engineering phase.

In general, the serialization approach is to map each object of the Asset Administration Shell metamodel to an AutomationML Role Class or to an AutomationML Role Class accompanied by an AutomationML Interface Class. This role class and (if applied) interface class also define the required attributes in AutomationML.

Asset Administration Shells themselves shall be modelled as AutomationML System Unit Classes or as Internal Elements within an Instance Hierarchy depending of the kind information of type and instance.

For the role classes and interface classes that are required for serialization, an AutomationML Role Class Library resp. an Interface Class Library are defined and provided to the public.

One of the goals is to ensure that the AutomationML model of the Asset Administration Shell can be used as a stand-alone AutomationML model, as well as in combination with existing AutomationML models such as the upcoming AutomationML Component Description. Therefore, the definition of the serialization approach defined in this clause is incorporated with the AutomationML definitions and applies the AutomationML technology definitions available on https://www.automationml.org/o.red.c/dateien.html.

link:#bib28[[28\]] is the AutomationML application recommendation for the Asset Administration Shell (AR AAS).

===  OPC UA

OPC UA is suited for the operating phase of Asset Administration Shellsfootnote:[OPC UA is used for several purposes in the context of Industry 4.0. In this document, however, the focus is on Asset Administration Shell representation only.] and especially applicable in case of machine-to-machine communication. The information model link:#bib42[[42\]] is the basis for the definition of so-called OPC UA Information Models, or OPC UA Companion Specifications link:#bib43[[43\]].

Note1 : the mapping to the OPC UA are carried out in a joint working groupfootnote:[see: https://opcfoundation.org/collaboration/i4aas/] "I4AAS" between OPC Foundation, ZVEI and VDMA (https://opcfoundation.org/markets-collaboration/I4AAS/ link:#bib30[[30\]].

=== Basic Concepts for Industry 4.0

Industry 4.0 describes concepts and definitions for the domain of smart manufacturing. For Industry 4.0, the term asset, being any "object which has a value for an organization", is of central importance link:#bib2[[2\]] link:#bib21[[21\]]. Industry 4.0 assets can take almost any form, e.g. a production system, a product, a software installation, intellectual properties, or even human resources.

According to link:#bib21[[21\]], the "reference architecture model Industry 4.0 (RAMI4.0) provides a structured view of the main elements of an asset using a level model consisting of three axes [...]. Complex interrelationships can thus be broken down into smaller, more manageable sections by combining all three axes at each point in the asset’s life to represent each relevant aspect."

Assets shall have a logical representation in the "information world", e.g. managed by IT systems. Consequently, an asset needs a precise identification as an entity, shall have a "specific state within its life (at least a type or instance)", shall have communication capabilities, shall be represented by means of information and shall be able to provide technical functionality link:#bib21[[21\]]. This logical representation of an asset is called Administration Shell link:#bib4[[4\]]. The combination of asset and Administration Shell forms the so-called I4.0 component. In international papers link:#bib19[[19\]], the term smart manufacturing replaces the term Industry 4.0.

As far as the large variety of assets in Industry 4.0 are concerned, the Asset Administration Shell allows these assets to be handled in the same manner within the information world. This reduces complexity and allows for scalability. Additional motivation can be found in link:#bib2[[2\]] link:#bib4[[4\]] link:#bib7[[7\]] link:#bib8[[8\]].

.Important Concepts of Industry 4.0 attached to the Asset link:#bib2[[2\]] link:#bib21[[21\]]
image::image60.jpeg[]

=== The Concept of Properties

According to link:#bib20[[20\]], the "IEC 61360 series provides a framework and an information model for product dictionaries. The concept of product type is represented by 'classes' and the product characteristics are represented by 'properties'".

Standardized data elements are an example for such properties. The definitions can be found in a range of repositories, such as IEC CDD (common data dictionary) or ECLASS. The definition of a property (aka standardized data element type, property type) associates a worldwide unique identifier with a definition, which is a set of well-defined attributes. Relevant attributes for the Administration Shell are, amongst others, the preferred name, the symbol, the unit of measure, and a human-readable textual definition of the property.

.Exemplary Definition of a Property the IEC CDD
image::image61.png[Ein Bild, das Tisch enthält. Automatisch generierte Beschreibung]

The instantiation of such a definition (just 'property', property instance) typically associates a value to the property. This mechanism makes it possible to convey semantically well-defined information to the Administration Shell.


====
Note: Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing in general will require many properties, which are beyond the current scope of IEC CDD, ECLASS, or other repositories. It is expected that these sets of properties will be introduced, as more and more domains are modelled and standardized (see next clause).
====


=== The Concept of Submodels

"The Administration Shell is the standardized digital representation of the asset, corner stone of the interoperability between the applications managing the manufacturing systems" link:#bib19[[19\]]. Hence, it should provide a minimal but sufficient description according to the different application scenarios in Industry 4.0 link:#bib7[[7\]] link:#bib8[[8\]]. Many different (international) standards, consortia and manufacturer specifications can already contribute to this description link:#bib19[[19\]].

As the figure shows, information from many different domains can be associated with a respective asset, and many different properties are required to be represented in Administration Shells of future I4.0 components. The architectural principle "separation of concerns" is supported by submodels.

.Examples of Different Domains Providing Properties for Submodels of the Administration Shell
image::image62.jpg[]

The Administration Shell is made up of a series of submodels link:#bib4[[4\]]. These represent different aspects of the asset concerned. For example, they may contain a description relating to safety or security link:#bib15[[15\]] but they could also outline various process capabilities such as drilling or installation link:#bib6[[6\]].

From an interoperability perspective, the goal is to standardize only a single submodel for each aspect/ technical domain. For example, it will be possible to find a drilling machine by searching for an Administration Shell containing a submodel "Drilling" with appropriate properties. Certain properties can then be assumed to exist for communication between different I4.0 components. In our example, a second submodel "energy efficiency" could make sure the drilling machine is able to cut its electricity consumption when out of operation.


====
Note: a side benefit of the Administration Shell will be to simplify the update of properties from product design (and in particular system design) tools, update properties from real data collected in the instances of assets, improve traceability of assets along the life cycle, and help certify assets from data.
====


=== Basic Structure of the Asset Administration Shell

The document on the structure of the Asset Administration Shell link:#bib4[[4\]] link:#bib19[[19\]] presents a rough, logical view of the Asset Administration Shell’s structure. The Asset Administration Shell – shown in blue in the following figure – comprises different sets of information. Both the asset and the Administration Shell are identified by a globally unique identifier. It comprises a number of submodels, which characterize the Asset Administration Shell.

.Basic Structure of the Asset Administration Shell
image::image63.jpeg[]

Properties, data, and functions will contain information that not every partner within a value-added network or even within an organizational unit should be able to access; its integrity and availability should be guaranteed. Therefore, the structure of the Administration Shell shall be able to handle aspects such as access protection, visibility, identity, and rights management, confidentiality, and integrity. Information security needs to be respected and has to be aligned with an overall security concept. Security implementation must go together with the implementation of other components of an overall system.

Each submodel contains a structured quantity of properties that can refer to data and functions. A standardized format based on IEC 61360-1/ ISO 13584-42 is envisaged for the properties. Property value definition shall follow the same principles as ISO 29002-10 and IEC 62832-2. Data and functions may be available in various complementary formats.

The properties of all the submodels therefore result in a constantly readable key information directory of the Administration Shell and hence of the I4.0 component. To enable binding semantics, Administration Shells, assets, submodels, and properties must all be clearly identified. For identification of these element the following types of global identifiers are allowed: IRDIs (used for example in ISO TS 29002-5, ECLASS and IEC CDD) and IRIs (Internationalized Resource Identifier, used for example in ontologies).

It should be possible to filter elements of the Administration Shell or submodels according to different given views (see example C.4 in link:#bib19[[19\]]). This facilitates different perspectives or use cases to access the Administration Shell's information.

=== How Are New Identifiers Created?

Following the different identification types from Clause 4.3.4, it can be stated that:

[loweralpha]
. IRDIs are assumed to already exist due to an external specification and standardization process in the creation of a certain Administration Shell. To bring such IRDI identifiers to life, please refer to Clause 5 of this document link:#bib4[[4\]].
. URIs and URLs can easily be created by developers when forming a certain Administration Shell. All they need is a valid authenticated URL, for example of the company. They also need to make sure that the domain (e.g. admin-shell.io) appended to the host’s name is reserved in a semantically unique way for these identifiers. This way, each developer can create an arbitrary URI or URL by combining the host name and some chosen path, which only needs to be unique in the developer's organization.
. Custom identifiers can also be easily formed by developers. They only need to make sure that internal custom identifiers can be clearly distinguished from (a) or (b).
. Local identifiers can also be created on the fly. They have to be unique within their namespace.

=== Best Practice for Creating URI Identifiers

The approach for semantics and interaction for I4.0 components link:#bib18[[18\]] suggests the use of the following structure (see Table 11) for URIsfootnote:[URLs are also URIs], which is slightly modified here. The idea is to always structure URIs following a scheme of different elements. However, this is just a recommendation and by no means mandatory.

.Proposed Structure for URIs
[cols="23%,64%,13%",options="header",]
|===
|*Element* |*Description* |*Syntax component*
|Organization |Legal body, administrative unit, or company issuing the ID |A
|Organizational subunit/document ID/document subunit |Sub entity in organization above, released specification, or publication of organization above |P
|Submodel/domain ID |Submodel of functional or knowledge-wise domain of asset or Administration Shell, which the identifier belongs to |P
|Version |Version number in line with release of specification or publication of identifier |P
|Revision |Revision number in line with release of specification or publication of identifier |P
|Property/element ID |Property or further structural element ID of the Administration Shell |P
|Instance number |Individual numbering of the instances within release of specification or publication |P
|===

In the table, syntax component "A" refers to authority of RFC 3986 (URI) and namespace identifier of RFC 2141 (URN); "P" refers to path of RFC 3986 (URI) and namespace specific string of RFC 2141 (URN).

[.underline]#Grammar:#

*<AAS URI> ::= <scheme> ":" <authority> [ <path> ]*

*<scheme> ::= a valid URI scheme*

*<authority> ::= Organization*

*<path> ::= <subunit> <domain> <release> <element>*

*<subunit> ::= \{ ("/" | ":") <Organizational Subunit/Document ID/Document subunit> }**

*<domain> ::= [ ("/" | ":") <Submodel / Domain-ID>*

*<release> ::= [ ("/" | ":") <Version> [ ("/" | ":") <Revision> ]* ]*

*<element> ::= [ ("/" | ":" | "#") \{( <Property/Element-ID> | <Instance number> )}* ]*

Using this scheme, valid URNs and URLs can be both created as URIs. The latter are preferred for Administration Shells, as functionality (such as REST services) can be bound to the identifiers. Examples of such identifiers are given in Table 12.

[appendix]
== Requirements

This annex collects the requirements from various documents that have impact on the specific structure of the Administration Shell. They serve as input for the specific description of the structures of the Administration Shell.

The following requirements are taken from the document "Implementation strategy of Plattform Industrie 4.0" link:#bib2[[2\]]footnote:[Only editorial changes]. They are marked "STRAT". The "Tracking" column validates the requirements by linking to features of the UML metamodel or this document in general.

[cols="13%,55%,32%",options="header",]
|===
|*ID* |*Requirement* |*Tracking*

The following requirements are taken from the document "The Structure of the Administration Shell:

Trilateral perspectives from France, Italy and Germany" link:#bib19[[19\]]. They are marked "tAAS".


====
Note: the term "property" was used in a very broad sense in previous publications of Plattform Industrie 4.0. The metamodel in this document distinguishes between properties in a more classical sense such as data elements like "maximum temperature" and other submodel elements like operations, events, etc.

[cols="16%,30%,54%",options="header",]
|===
|*Source* |*Requirement* |*Tracking*
|tAAS-#1 |The Administration Shell shall accept properties from different technical domains in mutually distinct submodels that can be version-controlled and maintained independently of each other. a|
_Identifiable_

_AdministrativeInformation_

_Submodel_

Requirement tAAS-#1 implicitly contains the requirements of versioning, which is supported for all elements inheriting from _Identifiable_.

Requirement tAAS-#1 is fulfilled because several submodels per Asset Administration Shell are possible. Every submodel is identifiable and an _Identifiable_ may contain administrative information (_AdministrativeInformation_) for versioning.

Submodels should be identifiable because they may be maintained independently of other submodels (requirement tAAS-#1) and can be reused within different Asset Administration Shells. However, since submodel elements may refer to elements from other Asset Administration Shells, dependencies have to be considered in parallel development and before reuse.

|tAAS-#2 |The Administration Shell should be capable of including properties from a wide range of technical domains and identify of which domain they were derived from. a|
_HasSemantics_

Definitions from different dictionaries and different domains can be used within submodels via semantic reference properties.

The only requirement is that the domain a property is derived from has a unique ID (_semanticId_).

|tAAS-#3 |Different procedural models should be allowed to find definitions within each relevant technical domain. The models should meet the requirements of standards, consortium specifications, and manufacturer specifications sets. a|
_HasSemantics/semanticId_ (see tAAS-#2)

_ConceptDescription_

Proprietary, manufacturer-specific property, or (more general) concept descriptions or copies from external dictionaries are supported by defining _ConceptDescriptions._ They are referenced in _semanticId_ via their global _ID_.

Predefined data specifications, e.g. for defining concept descriptions conformant to IEC 61360 are available in separate documents.

Usage of proprietary concept descriptions is not recommended because interoperability cannot be ensured.

|tAAS-#4 a|
Different Administration Shells in respect of an asset must be capable of referencing each other.

In particular, elements of an Administration Shell should be able to play the role of a "copy" of the corresponding components from another Administration Shell.

a|
_AssetAdministrationShell/derivedFrom_

The _derivedFrom_ relationship is especially designed to support the relationship between an Asset Administration Shell representing a type asset and the Asset Administration Shells representing the instance assets of this type asset.

See also tAAS-#16

|tAAS-#5 |Individual Administration Shells should, while retaining their structure, be combined into an overall Administration Shell. a|
_AssetAdministrationShell/assetInformation_

_RelationshipElement_

Relations between entities can be defined via the submodel element "_RelationshipElement_".

|tAAS-#6 |Identification of assets, Administration Shells, properties, and relationships shall be achieved using a limited set of identifiers (IRDI, URI, GUID), providing they offer global uniqueness. a|
_Identifiable_

Requirement tAAS-#6 is fulfilled for all elements inheriting from _Identifiable_. For example, this is the case for _Asset_, _AssetAdministrationShell,_ and concept descriptions. Properties (like any other submodel element) are only referable. However, unique referencing is possible via the unique submodel ID and the _Reference_ via __Key__s concept.

The supported ID types include IRDI, URI (since URI are a subset of _IRI_), IRI and GUID (via _Custom_) as requested.

|tAAS-#7 |The Administration Shell should allow retrieval of alternative identifiers such as a GS1 and GTIN identifier in return to asset ID (dereferencing). a|
_AssetInformation/specificAssetIds_

_AssetInformation/globalAssetId_

Every asset has a globally unique identifier (_globalAssetId_). Besides this global identifier, additional external identifiers can be specified (_specificAssetIds_).

|tAAS-#8 |The Administration Shell consists of header and body. a|
_AssetAdministrationShell_

_AssetAdministrationShell/id_

_AssetAdministrationShell/administration_

_AssetAdministrationShell/assetInformation_

The Asset Administration Shell does not explicitly distinguish between header and body. However, the Asset Administration Shell has defined attributes like the global unique ID (_identification_), version information (_administration_), a mandatory reference to the asset identifier information (_assetInformation_), etc.

|tAAS-#9 |The header contains information about the identification. a|
_AssetAdministrationShell/assetInformation_

The Asset Administrative Shell represents an asset with a unique ID.

See also tAAS-#7

See also tAAS-#13

|tAAS-#10 |The body contains information about the respective asset(s). a|
_AssetAdministrationShell/submodels_

All submodels provide information related to the asset presented by the Asset Administration Shell.


====
Note: an Asset Administration Shell represents exactly one asset. In case of a composite Asset Administration Shell, it implicitly represents several assets (see also tAAS-#5).
====


|tAAS-#11 |The information and functionality in the Administration Shell is accessible by means of a standardized application programming interface (API). |Covered in Part 2 of this document series link:#bib37[[37\]]
|tAAS-#12 |The Administration Shell has a unique ID. a|
_AssetAdministrationShell/id_

Since AssetAdministrationShell inherits from _Identifiable,_ requirement tAAS-#12 is fulfilled.

|tAAS-#13 |The asset has a unique ID. a|
_AssetInformation/globalAssetId_

The unique ID of the asset is the value of the globalAssetId.

See also Requirement tAAS-#7.

|tAAS-#14 |An industrial facility is also an asset, it has an Administration Shell and is accessible by means of ID. a|
_AssetInformation/globalAssetId_

The only assumption is that the industrial facility also has a globally unique ID that can be used as value of the _globalAssetId_.


====
Note: see also composite Asset Administration Shell (tAAS-#5) that allows the modelling of complex assets consisting of other assets that are represented by an Asset Administration Shell each.
====


|tAAS-#15 |Types and instances must be identified as such. a|
__AssetInformation/assetKind (__values: _Type or Instance)_

_AssetAdministrationShell/derivedFrom_

With attribute kind of Asset, Requirement tAAS-#15 is fulfilled, and type assets can be distinguished from instance assets.

Additionally, a _derivedFrom_ relationship can be established between the Asset Administration Shell for an instance asset and the Asset Administration Shell for the type asset.

|tAAS-#16 |The Administration Shell can include references to other Administration Shells or Smart Manufacturing information. a|
_ReferenceElement_

_File_

_Blob_

_AssetAdministrationShell/derivedFrom_

The _derivedFrom_ relationship between two Asset Administration Shells is special and is e.g. used to establish a relationship between instance assets and the type asset.

For composite Asset Administration Shells (see tAAS-#5), there is also the relationship to the Asset Administration Shell, which the composite Asset Administration Shell is composed of.

The _ReferenceElement_ is very generic and can reference another Asset Administration Shell as well as information within another Asset Administration Shell or even some information that is completely outside any Asset Administration Shell (as long as it has a global unique ID).

Files and blob can be used as submodel elements to include very generic manufacturing information that is not or cannot be modelled via properties or the other submodel elements defined for the Asset Administration Shell.

|tAAS-#17 |Additional properties, e. g. manufacturer-specific, must be possible. a|
_HasDataSpecification_

_ConceptDescription_

_HasExtensions_

Additional attributes for assets, properties, and other submodel elements, submodels, and even the Asset Administration Shell itself can be defined via data specification templates and checked by tools.

New proprietary concept descriptions (_ConceptDescription_) can be added and used for semantic definition of properties or other submodel elements.

Proprietary information can be added to any referable via extensions. The latter are not subject to standardization and can be ignored for interoperability use cases.

Other submodel elements and submodels can be added via API (see tAAS-#11), assuming the corresponding access permissions are given.

|tAAS-#18 |A reliable minimum number of properties must be defined for each Administration Shell. a|
_HasKind_ for _Submodel_

A reliable minimum number of properties is defined by the metamodel itself. They are called (class) attributes.

_HasKind_ _(with kind=Template) for Submodel_ enables the definition of submodel (element) templates. These templates define the structure and the semantics of a submodel instance (via _semanticId_).


====
Note: the term property within the metamodel has special semantics and shall not be confused with the implicitly available attributes of the different classes. Although these attributes might also be based on existing standards, they are no properties in the sense that a semantic reference can be added to define semantics externally. Semantics are defined for the metamodel itself in the class tables within this document.
====


|tAAS-#19 |The properties and other elements of information in the Administration Shell must be suitable for types and instances. a|
_HasKind_ (with _kind=Template_ or _kind=Instance_) for _Submodel_

All elements inheriting from _HasKind_ can distinguish between types (_kind=Template_) and instances (_kind=Instance_). This is especially true for _SubmodelElement_ and _Submodel_.


====
Note: submodels of _kind=Template_ do not describe an asset of _kind=Type_.
====


|tAAS-#20 |There must be a capability of hierarchical and countable structuring of the properties. a|
_SubmodelElementList_

_SubmodelElementCollection_

Requirement tAAS-#20 is fulfilled by lists and structs of data elements. Lists and structs are built recursively and contain other submodel elements of the same Asset Administration Shell. For referencing properties or other submodel elements of other Asset Administration Shells, a reference (_ReferenceElement_) or relationship element (_RelationshipElement_) needs to be included in the list or as element of the collection.

|tAAS-#21 |Properties shall be able to reference other properties, even in other Administration Shells. a|
_SubmodelElementList_

_SubmodelElementCollection_

_ReferenceElement_

_RelationshipElement_

_OperationVariable_ in _Operation_

A reference element can either reference any other element that is referable (i.e. inheriting from _Referable_) within the same or another Asset Administration Shell, or it can reference entities completely outside any Asset Administration Shell via its global ID.


====
Note: it is not always necessary to use a reference property for referencing elements within the same Asset Administration Shell. Depending on the context, submodel element collections, relations, etc. might be more suitable.
====


Other elements are also referenced or used as input or output argument via _OperationVariable_ within __operation__s.

== Backus-Naur-Form

The Backus-Naur form (BNF) – a meta-syntax notation for context-free grammars – is used to define grammars. For more information see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form).

A BNF specification is a set of derivation rules, written as

*<symbol> ::= __expression__*

where:

* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol[symbol]> is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonterminal[nonterminal] (variable) and the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(mathematics)[__expression__] consists of one or more sequences of either terminal or nonterminal symbols,
* ::= means that the symbol on the left must be replaced with the expression on the right,
* more sequences of symbols are separated by the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_bar[vertical bar] "|", indicating a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternation_(formal_language_theory)[choice], the whole being a possible substitution for the symbol on the left,
* symbols that never appear on a left side are https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_symbol[terminals], while symbols that appear on a left side are https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonterminal_symbol[non-terminals] and are always enclosed between the pair of angle brackets <>,
* terminals are enclosed with quotation marks: "text". "" is an empty string,
* optional items are enclosed in square brackets: [<item-x>],
* items existing 0 or more times are enclosed in curly brackets are suffixed with an asterisk (*) such as <word> ::= <letter> \{<letter>}*,
* Items existing 1 or more times are suffixed with an addition (plus) symbol, +, such as <word> ::= \{<letter>}+,
* round brackets are used to explicitly to define the order of expansion to indicate precedence, example: ( <symbol1> | <symbol2> ) <symbol3>,
* text without quotation marks is an informal explanation of what is expected; this text is cursive if grammar is non-recursive and vice versa.

[.underline]#Example:#

____
*<contact-address> ::= <name> "e-mail addresses:" <e-mail-Addresses>*

== Templates for UML Tables

=== General

The templates used for element specification are explained in this annex. For details for the semantics see Legend for UML Modelling.

For capitalization of titles, rules according to https://capitalizemytitle.com/ are used.

=== Template for Classes

Template for Classes:

[.table-with-appendix-table]
[cols="25%h,75%"]
|===
|Class: |<Class Name> [\<<abstract>>] ["\<<Experimental>>"] ["\<<Deprecated>>"] ["\<<Template>>"]
|Explanation: |<Explanatory text>
|Inherits from: |\{<Class Name> ";" }+ \| "-"
|===
[cols="25%,40%,25%,10%",options="header"]
|===
|Attribute |Explanation |Type |Card.
|<attribute or association name> ["\<<ordered>>"] ["\<<Experimental>>"] ["\<<Deprecated>>"] |<Explanatory text> |<Type> |<Card>
|===

The following stereotypes can be used:

* \<<abstract>>: Class cannot be instantiated but serves as superclass for inheriting classes
* \<<Experimental>>: Class is experimental, i.e. usage is only recommended for experimental purposes because non backward compatible changes may occur in future versions
* \<<Deprecated>>: Class is deprecated, i.e. it is recommended to not use the element any longer; it will be removed in a next major version of the model
* \<<Template>>: Class is a template only, i.e. class is not instantiated but used for additional specification purposes (for details see parts 3 of document series)
* The following kinds of _Types_ are distinguished:
* _Primitive:_ Type is no object type (class) but a data type; it is just a value
* _Class:_ Type is an object type (class); it is realized as composite aggregation (composition), and does not exist independent of its parent
* _Type:_
** _<Class>:_ Type is a class
** _ModelReference<\{Referable}>:_ Type is a Reference with _Reference/type=ModelReference_ and is called model reference; the \{Referable} is to be substituted by any referable element (including _Referable_ itself for the most generic case) – the element that is referred to is denoted in the __Key/type__=<\{Referable}> for the last _Key_ in the model reference; for the graphical representation see Legend for UML Modelling, Figure 82; for more information on referencing see Clause 5.3.9.
** _<Primitive>: Type_ is a primitive data type, see Clause 5.3.11
** _<Enumeration>:_ Type is an enumeration
* _Card._ is the cardinality (or multiplicity) defining the lower and upper bound of the number of instances of the member element. "*" denotes an arbitrary infinite number of elements of the corresponding Type. "0..1" means optional. "0..*" or "0..3" etc. means that the list may be either not available (null object) or empty.


====
Note 1: attributes having a default value are always considered to be optional; there is always a value for the attribute because the default value is used for initialization in this case.
====



====
Note 2: attributes or attribute elements with data type “string” or “langString” are considered to consist of at least one character.
====



====
Note 3: optional lists, i.e. attributes with cardinality > 1 and minimum 0, are considered to consist of at least one element.
====


[.underline]#Examples for valid model references#

If class type equal to "ModelReference<xref:Submodel[Submodel]>", the following reference would be a valid reference (using the text serialization as defined in Clause 7.2.3):

*(Submodel)https://example.com/aas/1/1/1234859590*

If class type equal to "ModelReference<xref:Referable[Referable]>", the following references would be valid references (using the text serialization as defined in Clause 7.2.3):

*(Submodel)https://example.com/aas/1/1/1234859590*

*(Submodel)https://example.com/aas/1/1/1234859590, (Property)temperature*

*(Submodel)https://example.com/aas/1/1/1234859590, (File)myDocument*

This would be an invalid reference for "ModelReference<xref:Referable[Referable]>", instead type "Reference" shall be used:

*(Submodel)https://example.com/aas/1/1/1234859590, (File)myDocument (FragmentReference)Hints*

This would be an invalid reference for "ModelReference<xref:Submodel[Submodel]>"

*(Submodel)https://example.com/aas/1/1/1234859590, (Property)temperature*

=== Template for Enumerations

Template for Enumerations:

[.table-with-appendix-table]
[cols="30%h,70%"]
|===
|Enumeration: |<Enumeration Name> ["\<<Experimental>>"] ["\<<Deprecated>>"]
|Explanation: |
|Set of: |\{<Enumeration> ";" }+ \| "-"
|===
[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]

|<enumValue1>["\<<Experimental>>"] ["\<<Deprecated>>"] a|
<Explanatory text>

Value of enumeration

|<enumValue2> ["\<<Experimental>>"] ["\<<Deprecated>>"] a|
<Explanatory text>

Value of enumeration, also included in one of the enumerations listed in "Set of:"

|===

"Set Of" lists enumerations that are contained in the enumeration. It is only relevant for validation, making sure that all elements relevant for the enumeration are considered.

Enumeration values use Camel Case notation and start with a small letter. However, there might be exceptions in case of very well-known enumeration values.

=== Template for Primitives

Template for Primitive:

[cols="20%,25%,55%",options="header",]
|===
|*Primitive* |*Explanation* |*Value Examples*

=== Handling of Constraints

Constraints are prefixed with *AASd-* followed by a three-digit number. The "d" in "AASd-" was motivated by "in Detail". The numbering of constraints is unique within namespace AASd; a number of a constraint that was removed will not be used again.


====
Note: in the Annex listing the metamodel changes, constraints with prefix AASs- or AASc- are also listed. These are security or data specification constraints, and are now part of the split document parts.

[appendix]
== Legend for UML Modelling

=== OMG UML General

This annex explains the UML elements used in this specification. For more information, please refer to the comprehensive literature available for UML. The formal specification can be found in link:#bib35[[35\]].

Figure 63 shows a class with name "Class1" and an attribute with name "attr" of type _Class2_. Attributes are owned by the class. Some of these attributes may represents the end of binary associations, see also Figure 70. In this case, the instance of _Class2_ is navigable via the instance of the owning class _Class1_.footnote:[„Navigability notation was often used in the past according to an informal convention, whereby non-navigable ends were assumed to be owned by the Association whereas navigable ends were assumed to be owned by the Classifier at the opposite end. This convention is now deprecated. Aggregation type, navigability, and end ownership are separate concepts, each with their own explicit notation. Association ends owned by classes are always navigable, while those owned by associations may be navigable or not. link:#bib35[[35\]]”]

.Class
image::image64.png[]

Figure 64 shows that _Class4_ inherits all member elements from _Class3_. Or in other word, _Class3_ is a generalization of _Class4, Class4_ is a specialization of _Class3_. This means that each instance of _Class4_ is also an instance of _Class3_. An instance of _Class4_ has the attributes _attr1_ and _attr2,_ whereas instances of _Class3_ only have the attribute _attr1_.

.Inheritance/Generalization
image::image65.png[]

Figure 65 defines the required and allowed multiplicity/cardinality within an association between instances of _Class1_ and _Class2_. In this example, an instance of _Class2_ is always related to exactly one instance of _Class1_. An instance of _Class1_ is either related to none, one, or more (unlimited, i.e. no constraint on the upper bound) instances of _Class2_. The relationship can change over time.

Multiplicity constraints can also be added to attributes and aggregations.

The notation of multiplicity is as follows:

<lower-bound>.. <upper-bound>

where <lower-bound> is a value specification of type Integer - i.e. 0, 1, 2, … - and <upper-bound> is a value specification of type UnlimitedNatural. The star character (*) is used to denote an unlimited upper bound.

The default is 1 for lower-bound and upper-bound.

.Multiplicity
image::image66.png[]

A multiplicity element represents a collection of values. The default is a set, i.e. it is not ordered and the elements within the collection are unique and contain no duplicates. Figure 66 shows an ordered collection: the instances of _Class2_ related to an instance of _Class1_. The stereotype \<<ordered>> is used to denote that the relationship is ordered.

.Ordered Multiplicity
image::image67.png[]

Figure 67 shows that the member ends of an association can be named as well, i.e. an instance of _Class1_ can be in relationship "relation" to an instance of _Class2_. Vice versa, the instance of _Class2_ is in relationship "reverseRelation" to the instance of _Class1_.

.Association
image::image67.png[]

Figure 68 shows a composition, also called a composite aggregation. A composition is a binary association, grouping a set of instances. The individuals in the set are typed as specified by _Class2_. The multiplicity of instances of _Class2_ to _Class1_ is always 1 (i.e. upper-bound and lower-bound have value "1"). One instance of _Class2_ belongs to exactly one instance of _Class1_. There is no instance of _Class2_ without a relationship to an instance of _Class1_. Figure 69 shows the composition using an association relationship with a filled diamond as composition adornment.

.Composition (Composite Aggregation)
image::image68.png[]

Figure 69 shows an aggregation. An aggregation is a binary association. In contrast to a composition, an instance of _Class2_ can be shared by several instances of _Class1_. Figure 69 shows the shared aggregation using an association relationship with a hallow diamond as aggregation adornment.

.Aggregation
image::image69.png[]

Figure 70 illustrates that the attribute notation can be used for an association end owned by a class. In this example, the attribute name is "attr" and the elements of this attribute are typed with _Class2._ The multiplicity, here "0..*", is added in square brackets. If the aggregation is ordered, it is added in curly brackets like in this example.

.Navigable Attribute Notation for Associations
image::image70.png[]

Figure 71 shows a class with three attributes with primitive types and default values. When a property with a default value is instantiated in the absence of a specific setting for the property, the default value is evaluated to provide the initial values of the property.

.Default Value
image::image71.png[]

Figure 72 shows that there is a dependency relationship between _Class1_ and _Class2_. In this case, the dependency means that _Class1_ depends on _Class2_ because the type of attribute _attr_ depends on the specification of class _Class2._ A dependency is depicted as dashed arrow between two model elements.

.Dependency
image::image72.png[]

Figure 73 shows an abstract class. It uses the stereotype \<<abstract>>. There are no instances of abstract classes. They are typically used for specific member elements that are inherited by non-abstract classes.

.Abstract Class
image::image73.png[]

Figure 74 shows a package named "Package2". A package is a namespace for its members. In this example, the member belonging to _Package2_ is class _Class2_.

.Package
image::image74.png[]

Figure 75 shows that all elements in _Package2_ are imported into the namespace defined by _Package1_. This is a special dependency relationship between the two packages with stereotype \<<import>>.

.Imported Package
image::image75.png[]

Figure 76 shows an enumeration with the name "Enumeration1". An enumeration is a data type with its values enumerated as literals. It contains two literal values, "a" and "b". It is a class with stereotype \<<enumeration>>. The literals owned by the enumeration are ordered.

.Enumerationfootnote:[In Enterprise Architect, the single enumeration values also have a stereotype \<<enum>> each.]
image::image76.png[]

Figure 77 shows the definition of the data type with the name "DataType1". A data type has instances that are identified only by their value. It is a class with stereotype \<<dataType>>.

.Data Type
image::image77.png[]

Figure 78 shows a primitive data type with the name "int". Primitive data types are predefined data types, without any substructure. The primitive data types are defined outside UML.

.Primitive Data Type
image::image78.png[]

Figure 79 shows how a note can be attached to an element, in this example to class "Class1".

.Note
image::image79.png[]

Figure 80 shows how a constraint is attached to an element, in this example to class "Class1".

.Constraint
image::image80.png[]


=== UML Naming Rules

The following rules are used for naming of classes, attributes etc.:

* all names use CamelCase; for exceptions see rules for Enumeration values,
* class names always start with a capital letter,
* attribute names always start with a small letter,
* primitive types start with a capital letter; exception: predefined types of XSD like string,
* enumerations start with a capital letter,
* names of member ends of an association start with a capital letter,
* all stereotypes specific to the Asset Administration Shell specification start with a capital letter, e.g. "\<<Deprecated>>"; predefined stereotypes in UML start with a small letter, e.g. "\<<abstract>>" or "\<<enumeration>>".

In UML, the convention is to name associations and aggregations in singular form. The multiplicity is to be taken into account to decide on whether there are none, a single, or several elements in the corresponding association or aggregation.


====
Note: a plural form of the name of attributes with cardinality >=1 may be needed in some serializations (e.g. in JSON). In this case, it is recommended to add an "s". In case of resulting incorrect English (e.g. isCaseOf isCaseOfs), it must be decided whether or not to support such exceptions.
====


=== Templates, Inheritance, Qualifiers, and Categories

At first glance, there seems to be some overlapping within the concepts of data specification templates, extensions, inheritance, qualifiers, and categories introduced in the metamodel. This clause explains the commonalities and differences and gives hints for good practices.

In general, an extension of the metamodel by inheritance is foreseen. Templates might also be used as alternatives.

* Extensions can be used to add proprietary and/or temporary information to an element. Extensions do not support interoperability. They can be used as work-around for missing properties in the standard. In this case, the same extensions are attached to all elements of a specific class (e.g. to properties). However, in general, extensions can be attached in a quite arbitrary way. Properties are defined in a predefined way as key values pairs (in this case keys named "name").
* In contrast to extensions, templates aim at enabling interoperability between the partners that agree on the template. A template defines a set of attributes, each of them with clear semantics. This set of attributes corresponds to a (sub-)schema. Templates should only be used if different instances of the class follow different schemas and the templates for the schemas are not known at design time of the metamodel. Templates might also be used if the overall metamodel is not yet stable enough or a tool supports templates but not (yet) the complete metamodel. Typically, all instances of a specific class with the same category provide the same attribute values conformant to the template. In contrast to extensions, the attributes in the template have speaking names.


====
Note: categories are deprecated and should no longer be used.
====


* However, when using non-standardized proprietary data specification templates, interoperability cannot be ensured and thus should be avoided whenever possible.
* In case all instances of a class follow the same schema, inheritance and/or categories should be used.
* Categories can be used if all instances of a class follow the same schema but have different constraints depending on their category. Such a constraint might specify that an optional attribute is mandatory for this category (like the unit that is mandatory for properties representing physical values). Realizing the same via inheritance would lead to multiple inheritance – a state that is to be avoidedfootnote:[Exception: multiple inheritance is used in this specification, but only in case of inheriting from abstract classes.].


====
Note: categories are deprecated and should no longer be used.
====


* Qualifiers are used if the structure and the semantics of the element is the same independent of its qualifiers. Only the quality or the meaning of the value for the element differs.
* Value qualifiers are used if only the quantity but not the semantics of the value changes. Depending on the application, either both value and qualifier define the "real" semantics together, or the qualifier is not really relevant and is ignored by the application. Example: the actual temperature might be good enough for non-critical visualization of trends, independent of whether the temperature is measured or just estimated (qualifier would denote: measured or estimated).
* Concept qualifiers are used to avoid multiplying existing semantically clearly defined concepts with the corresponding qualifier information, e.g. life cycle.
* Template qualifiers are used to guide the creation and validation of element instances.

=== Notes to Graphical UML Representation

Specific graphical modelling rules, which are used in this specification but not included in this form, are explained below link:#bib35[[35\]].

Figure 81 shows different graphical representations of a composition (composite aggregation). In Variant A, a relationship with a filled aggregation diamond is used. In Variant B, an attribute with the same semantics is defined. And in Variant C, the implicitly assumed default name of the attribute in Variant A is explicitly stated. This document uses notation B.

It is assumed that only the end member of the association is navigable per default, i.e. it is possible to navigate from an instance of _Class1_ to the owned instance of _Class2_ but not vice versa. If there is no name for the end member of the association given, it is assumed that the name is identical to the class name but starting with a small letter – compared to Variant C.

_Class2_ instance only exists if the parent object of type _Class1_ exists.

.Graphical Representations of Composite Aggregation/Composition
image::image81.png[]

Figure 82 shows different representations of a shared aggregation: a _Class2_ instance can exist independently of a _Class1_ instance; it only references the instances of _Class2_. Now an attribute with the same semantics is defined In Variant B. The reference is denoted by a star added after the type of the attribute.

It is assumed that only the end member of the aggregation association is navigable per default, i.e. it is possible to navigate from an instance of _Class1_ to the owned instance of _Class2_ but not vice versa. Otherwise, variant B would not be identical to Variant A.

.Graphical Representation of Shared Aggregation
image::image82.png[]

A specialty in Figure 82 is that the aggregated instances are referables in the sense of the Asset Administration Shell metamodel (i.e. they inherit from the predefined abstract class "Referable"). This is why Variant B is identical to Variant A. This would not be the case for non-referable elements in the metamodel. The structure of a reference to a model element of the Asset Administration Shell is explicitly defined. A model reference consists of an ordered list of keys. The last key in the key chain shall reference an instance of type _Class2_ (i.e. Reference.

Figure 83 show different graphical representations of generalization. Variant A is the classical graphical representation as defined in link:#bib35[[35\]]. Variant B is a short form, if _Class1_ is not on the same diagram. The name of the class that _Class3_ is inheriting from is depicted in the upper right corner.

Variant C not only shows which class Class3 instances are inheriting from, but also what they are inheriting. This is depicted by the class name it is inheriting from, followed by "::" and then the list of all inherited elements – here attribute _class2_. Typically, the inherited elements are not shown.

.Graphical Representation of Generalization/Inheritance
image::image83.png[]

Figure 84 depicts different graphical notations for enumerations in combination with inheritance. On the left side "Enumeration1" additionally contains the literals as defined by "Enumeration2".

====
Note 1: the direction of inheritance is opposite to the one for class inheritance. This can be seen at the right side of Figure 84 that defines the same enumeration but without inheritance.
====

.Graphical Representation for Enumeration with Inheritance

== How to Use the Metamodel

=== Composite I4.0 Components

As described in Clause 4.2.1, there is a class of relationships between assets of different hierarchy levels. In this class of relationships, automation equipment is explained as a complex, interrelated graph of automation devices and products, performing intelligent production and self-learning/optimization tasks.

Details and examples for composite I4.0 Components can be found in link:#bib13[[13\]].

The following modelling elements in the Asset Administration Shell metamodel can be used to realize such composite I4.0 Components:

* _RelationshipElement,_ used to describe relationships between assets and other elements,
* _Submodel,_ where a complex asset is composed out of other entities and assets, which are specified in a bill of material together with their relationship to each other.


====
Note: the submodel template defining the structure of such a bill of material is not predefined by the Asset Administration Shell metamodel. However, _Entity_ elements were designed for the purpose of building bills of material.
====


* Not every entity (_Entity_) that is part of the bill of material of an asset necessarily has its own Asset Administration Shell. As described in link:#bib13[[13\]], self-managed entities are distinguished from co-managed entities (_Entity/entityType_).
[arabic]
. Self-Managed Entities have their own Asset Administration Shell. This is why a reference to this asset is specified via _Entity/globalAssetId_ or an _Entity/specificAssetId_. Additionally, further property statements (_Entity/statement_) link:#bib16[[16\]] can be added to the asset that are not specified in the Asset Administration Shell of the asset itself, since they are specified in relation to the composite I4.0 Component only.
. There is no separate Asset Administration Shell for co-managed entities. The relationships and property statements of such entities are managed within the Asset Administration Shell of the composite I4.0 Component.

Figure 88 shows an extract of the metamodel containing the most important elements to describe composite I4.0 Components.

== Metamodel UML with Inherited Attributes

In this annex, some UML diagrams are shown together with all attributes inherited for a better overview.

.Selected Classes of Metamodel with Inherited Attributes
image::image89.png[]

====
Note: abstract classes are numbered h0_, h1_ etc. Their aliases however are defined without this prefix. The reason for this naming is that no order for inherited classes can be defined in the tooling used for UML modelling (Enterprise Architect); they are ordered alphabetically.

[appendix]
== Metamodel Changes

=== General

This annex lists the changes from version to version of the metamodel, together with major changes in the overall document. Non-backward compatible changes (nc) are marked as such.

nc="x" means non-backward compatible; if no value is added in the table, then the change is backward compatible.

nc="(x)" means that the change made was implicitly contained or stated in the document before and is now being formalized. Therefore, the change is considered to be backward compatible.

Before splitting the document, changes to the data specification templates and the security of the metamodel were listed in separate tables.

Three tables are introduced to explain the changes:

. changes w.r.t. previous version,
. new elements in metamodel w.r.t previous version,
. new, changed, or removed constraints w.r.t previous version.

If there are no changes the corresponding tables are obmitted.


====
Note: before V3.0, the security metamodel and the predefined data specifications were also part of this document. Therefore, security metamodel changes were listed using the three subclauses as described above.

Constraint AASd-022: idShort of non-identifiable Referables within the same name space shall be unique (case-sensitive)

| |AASd-027 |Removed a|
Not needed any longer since Type of idShort was changed to NameType and NameType has a maximum length of 128 characters

Constraint AASd-027: idShort of Referables shall have a maximum length of 128 characters

| |AASd-077 |Reformulated |Constraint AASd-077: the name of an extension (Extension/name) within HasExtensions needs to be unique
| |AASd-100 |Removed a|
Since new string types with length constraints were added, this constraint is no longer needed

Constraint AASd-100: An attribute with data type "string" is not allowed to be empty

| |AASd-109 |Reformulated |Constraint AASd-109: If SubmodelElementList/typeValueListElement is equal to Property or Range, SubmodelElementList/­valueTypeListElement shall be set and all first level child elements in the SubmodelElementList shall have the value type as specified in SubmodelElementList/­valueTypeListElement.
| |AASd-115 |Reformulated |Constraint AASd-115: If a first level child element in a SubmodelElementList does not specify a semanticId, the value is assumed to be identical to SubmodelElementList/­semanticIdListElement.
| |AASd-117 |Bugfix |Constraint AASd-117: idShort of non-identifiable Referables not being a direct child of a SubmodelElementList shall be specified.
| |AASd-118 |Reformulated |Constraint AASd-118: If a supplemental semantic ID (HasSemantics/supplementalSemanticId) is defined, there shall also be a main semantic ID (HasSemantics/semanticId).
| |AASd-119 |Reformulated |Constraint AASd-119: If any Qualifier/kind value of a Qualifiable/qualifier is equal to TemplateQualifier and the qualified element inherits from "hasKind", the qualified element shall be of kind Template (HasKind/kind = "Template").
| |AASd-120 |Reformulated |Constraint AASd-120: idShort of submodel elements being a direct child of a SubmodelElementList shall not be specified.
| |AASd-121 |Reformulated |Constraint AASd-121: For References the value of Key/type of the first key of Reference/keys shall be one of GloballyIdentifiables.
| |AASd-122 |Reformulated |Constraint AASd-122: For external references, i.e. References with Reference/type = ExternalReference, the value of Key/type of the first key of Reference/keys shall be one of GenericGloballyIdentifiables.
| |AASd-123 |Reformulated |Constraint AASd-123: For model references, i.e. References with Reference/type = ModelReference, the value of Key/type of the first key of Reference/keys shall be one of AasIdentifiables.

| |AASd-125 |Reformulated |Constraint AASd-125: For model references, i.e. References with Reference/type = ModelReference with more than one key in Reference/keys, the value of Key/type of each of the keys following the first key of Reference/keys shall be one of FragmentKeys.
| |AASd-126 |Reformulated |Constraint AASd-126: For model references, i.e. References with Reference/type = ModelReference with more than one key in Reference/keys, the value of Key/type of the last Key in the reference key chain may be one of GenericFragmentKeys, or no key at all shall have a value out of GenericFragmentKeys.
| |AASd-127 |Reformulated |Constraint AASd-127: For model references, i.e. References with Reference/type = ModelReference with more than one key in Reference/keys, a key with Key/type FragmentReference shall be preceded by a key with Key/type File or Blob. All other AAS fragments, i.e. Key/type values out of AasSubmodelElements, do not support fragments.
| |AASd-129 |New a|
Necessary as supplement for AASd-119, since SubmodelElement does not inherit from HasKind any longer

Constraint AASd-129: If any Qualifier/kind value of a SubmodelElement/qualifier (attribute qualifier inherited via Qualifiable) is equal to TemplateQualifier, the submodel element shall be part of a submodel template, i.e. a Submodel with Submodel/kind (attribute kind inherited via HasKind) value to Template.

|x |AASd-130 |New a|
Ensures that encoding is possible and interoperability between different serializations is possible.

Constraint AASd-130: An attribute with data type "string" shall consist of these characters only: ^[\x09\x0A\x0D\x20-\uD7FF\uE000-\uFFFD\u00010000-\u0010FFFF]*$.

| |AASd-051 |Removed a|
Since category is deprecated, this constraint was removed.

Views are no longer supported by metamodel
