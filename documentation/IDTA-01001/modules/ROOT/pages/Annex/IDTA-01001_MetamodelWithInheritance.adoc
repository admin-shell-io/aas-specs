In this annex, some UML diagrams are shown together with all attributes inherited for a better overview.

====
Note: abstract classes are numbered h0_, h1_ etc. Their aliases however are defined without this prefix. The reason for this naming is that no order for inherited classes can be defined in the tooling used for UML modelling (Enterprise Architect); they are ordered alphabetically.
