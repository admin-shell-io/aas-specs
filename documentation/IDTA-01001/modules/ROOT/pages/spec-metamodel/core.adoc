== Asset Administration Shell Attributes

.Metamodel of an AssetAdministrationShell
image::image24.png[]

An Administration Shell is uniquely identifiable since it inherits from _Identifiable_.

The _derivedFrom_ attribute is used to establish a relationship between two Asset Administration Shells that are derived from each other. For more detailed information on the _derivedFrom_ concept, see Clause xref:general.adoc#types-and-instances[Types and Instances].

Reference to a submodel of the Asset Administration Shell

A submodel is a description of an aspect of the asset the Asset Administration Shell is representing.

The asset of an Asset Administration Shell is typically described by one or more submodels.

Temporarily, no submodel might be assigned to the Asset Administration Shell.

h|Class: 3+e|[[AssetInformation]]AssetInformation
h|Explanation: 3+a|
In _AssetInformation,_ identifying meta data of the asset that is represented by an Asset Administration Shell is defined.

The asset may either represent a type asset or an instance asset.

The asset has a globally unique identifier, plus – if needed – additional domain-specific (proprietary) identifiers. However, to support the corner case of very first phase of life cycle where a stabilized/constant global asset identifier does not already exist, the corresponding attribute "globalAssetId" is optional.

Identifier of the asset the Asset Administration Shell is representing

This attribute is required as soon as the Asset Administration Shell is exchanged via partners in the life cycle of the asset. In a first phase of the life cycle, the asset might not yet have a global asset ID but already an internal identifier. The internal identifier would be modelled via "specificAssetId".

For more information on the concept of subject, see Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) xref:bibliography.adoc#bib49[[49\]]. The assumption is that every subject has a unique identifier.

== Submodel Attributes

.Metamodel of Submodel
image::image26.png[]

Adding a _semanticId_ for a submodel is recommended (see Table 2).

If the submodel is of _kind=Template_ (modelling kind as inherited by _HasKind_), the submodel elements within the submodel are presenting submodel element templates. If the submodel is of _kind=Instance_, its submodel elements represent submodel element instances.


====
Note: validators shall handle a submodel like _SubmodelElementCollection/submodelElements_ and not like a _SubmodelElementList/value_. The difference is that a submodel is identifiable and a predefined unit of information within the Asset Administration Shell.

h|Class: 3+e|[[Submodel]]Submodel
h|Explanation: 3+a|
A submodel defines a specific aspect of the asset represented by the Asset Administration Shell.

A submodel is used to structure the digital representation and technical functionality of an Administration Shell into distinguishable parts. Each submodel refers to a well-defined domain or subject matter. Submodels can become standardized and, in turn, submodel templates.

== Submodel Element Attributes

.Metamodel of Submodel Element
image::image27.png[]

Submodel elements are qualifiable elements, i.e. one or more qualifiers may be defined for each of them.

It is recommended to add a _semanticId_ to a _SubmodelElement._

Submodel elements may also have defined data specification templates. A template might be defined to mirror some of the attributes like _preferredName_ and _unit_ of a property concept definition if there is no corresponding concept description available. Otherwise, there is only the property definition referenced by _semanticId_ available for the property; the attributes must be looked up online in a different way and are not available offline.
