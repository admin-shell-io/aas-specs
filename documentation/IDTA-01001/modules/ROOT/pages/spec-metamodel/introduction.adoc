= Introduction

This clause specifies the information metamodel of the Asset Administration Shell.

An overview of the metamodel of the Asset Administration Shell is given in Subclause xref:spec-metamodel/overview.adoc[];
Subclause xref:spec-metamodel/designators.adoc[] describes the classes and all their attributes in detail.

The legend of the UML diagrams and the table specification of the classes is explained in Annex xref:ROOT:annex/uml-templates.adoc[] and Annex xref:ROOT:annex/uml.adoc[].
Readers familiar with UML may skip the first clause in Annex xref:ROOT:annex/uml.adoc[].
It is however recommended to have a look at the specifics used in this modelling, especially those on dealing with model references.
