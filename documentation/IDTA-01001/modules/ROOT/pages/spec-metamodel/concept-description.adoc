h|Explanation: 3+a|
The semantics of a property or other elements that may have a semantic description is defined by a concept description.

The description of the concept should follow a standardized schema (realized as data specification template).

|===

Different types of submodel elements require different attributes to describe their semantics.
This is why a concept description has at least one data specification template associated with it.
This template defines the attributes needed to describe the semantics.

See IDTA-01003 series for predefined data specification templates.
