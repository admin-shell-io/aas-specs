= Overview of Submodel Element Types

.Metamodel Overview for Submodel Element Subtypes
image::image28.png[]

Submodel elements include data properties as well as operations, events and other elements needed to describe a model for an asset (see Figure 27).

== General

All submodel elements including abstract classes like data elements are specified in alphabetical order.

== Annotated Relationship Element Attributes

.Metamodel of Annotated Relationship Elements
image::image29.png[]

An annotated relationship is a relationship similar to a ternary association in UML. The semantics of the relationship is defined via the _semanticId_ of the _RelationshipElement_. If this semantic definition requires additional information not contained in the _first_ or _second_ object referenced via the relationship, this information needs to be stored as annotation.

Note: the _semanticId_ of a capability is typically an ontology, which enables reasoning on capabilities. For information and examples on how to apply the concept of capability and how to map it to one or more skills implementing the capability, please refer to link:#bib27[[27\]]. The mapping is done via a relationship element with the corresponding semantics. A skill is typically a property or an operation. In more complex cases, the mapping can also be a collection or a complete submodel.

== Data Element and Overview of Data Element Types

.Metamodel of Data Elements
image::image34.png[]

A data element is a submodel element that is not further composed of other submodel elements.

A data element is a submodel element that has a value or a predefined number of values like range data elements.

The type of value differs for different subtypes of data elements. Data elements include properties, file handling, and reference elements, see Figure 33.

== Relationship Element Attributes

The semantics of the relationship is defined via the _semanticId_ of the _RelationshipElement_. If this semantic definition requires additional information not contained in the _first_ or _second_ object referenced via the relationship, the submodel element type xref:AnnotatedRelationsshipElement[AnnotatedRelationshipElement] shall be used instead.

== Submodel Element Collection Attributes

.Metamodel of Submodel Element Collections
image::image44.png[]

Submodel Element Collections are used for complex elements with a typically fixed set of properties with unique names. This set of properties is typically predefined by the semantic definition (referenced via _semanticId_) of the submodel element collection. Each property within the collection itself should have clearly defined semantics.


=
Note: the different elements of a submodel element collection do not have to have different __semanticId__s. However, in these cases the usage of a _SubmodelElementList_ should be considered.
=


Example: a single document has a predefined set of properties like title, version, author, etc. They logically belong to a document. So a single document is represented by a _SubmodelElementCollection_. An asset usually has many different documents available like operating instructions, safety instructions, etc. The set of all documents is represented by a _SubmodelElementList_ (see Clause _5.3.7.17)_. In this case, we have a _SubmodelElementList_ of __SubmodelElementCollection__s.


=
Note: the elements within a submodel element collection are not ordered. Every element has a unique ID (its "idShort"). However, it is recommended to adhere to the order defined in the submodel template.

.Metamodel of Submodel Element Lists
image::image45.png[]

Submodel element lists are used for sets (i.e. unordered collections without duplicates), ordered lists (i.e. ordered collections that may contain duplicates), bags (i.e. unordered collections that may contain duplicates), and ordered sets (i.e. ordered collections without duplicates).

Note: there is no _idShort_ for submodel elements in lists (see Constraint AASd-120).

Submodel element lists are also used to create multi-dimensional arrays. A two-dimensional array listlink:#bib3[[3\]]link:#bib5[[5\]] with _Property_ values would be realized like follows: the first submodel element list would contain three _SubmodelElementList_ elements. Each of these three _SubmodelElementLists_ would contain 5 single _Property_ elements. The _semanticId_ of the contained properties would be the same for all lists in the first list, i.e. _semanticIdListElement_ would be identical for all three lists contained in the first list. The _semanticId_ of the three contained lists would differ depending on the dimension it represents. In case of complex values in the array, a _SubmodelElementCollection_ would be used as values in the leaf lists.

Similarly, a table with three columns can be represented. In this case a _SubmodelElementCollection_ with three _SubmodelElementLists_ would be contained and the _semanticId_ as well as the _semanticIdListElement_ for the three columns would differ.

Matching strategies for semantic IDs are explained in Clause 4.4.1.

h|Explanation: 3+a|
A submodel element list is an ordered list of submodel elements.


=
Note: the list is ordered although the ordering might not be relevant (see attribute "orderRelevant".)

The numbering starts with Zero (0).
