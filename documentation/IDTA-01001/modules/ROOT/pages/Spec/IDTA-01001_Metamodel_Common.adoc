= Common Attributes

== General

This clause specifies the abstract classes that represent commonly used attributes and terminology, together with the classes and data types exclusively used in these classes. They are represented in alphabetical order.

== Administrative Information Attributes

.Metamodel of Administrative Information
image::image14.png[]

Every identifiable may contain administrative information. Administrative information includes, for example,

* information about the version of the element,
* information about who created or who made the last change to the element,
* information about the languages available in case the element contains text; the master or default language may also be defined for translating purposes,
* information about the submodel template that guides the creation of the submodel

In principle, the version corresponds to the _version_identifier_ according to IEC 62832. However, it is not used for concept identifiers only (IEC TS 62832-1), but for all identifiable elements. Together, version and revision correspond to the version number according to IEC 62832.

Other attributes of the administrative information like creator refer to ISO 15836-1:2017, the Dublin Core metadata element set.

For more information on the concept of subject, see Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) link:#bib49[[49\]]. The assumption is that every subject has a unique identifier.


xref:AdministrativeInformation[AdministrativeInformation] allows the usage of templates (xref:HasDataSpecification[HasDataSpecification]). Data specifications are defined in separate documents.


====
Note 1: two submodels with the same semanticId but different administrative information shall have different IDs (_Submodel/id_), since they denote that the submodel is not backward compatible or has some other major administrative changes. The _idShort_ typically does not change. The same applies to other identifiables (_Identifiable/id_). Otherwise, the ID of a submodel would not be sufficient to identify the data or service provided by the submodel.
====



====
Note 2: since submodels with different versions shall have different identifiers, it is possible that an Asset Administration Shell has two submodels with the same _semanticId_ but different versions, i.e. different administrative metainformation.
====



====
Note 3: some of the administrative information like the version number might need to be part of the identification. This is similar to the handling of identifiers for concept descriptions using IRDIs. In ECLASS, the IRDI 0173-1#02-AO677#002 contains the version information #002.
====



====
Note 4: the process of versioning or adding other administrative information to elements is done by external version or configuration management software and not by the Asset Administration Shell itself.

== Identifiable Attributes

.Metamodel of Identifiables
image::image19.png[]

An identifiable element is a referable with a globally unique identifier (_Identifier_). Only the global ID (_Identifiable/id_) shall be used to reference an identifiable, because the _idShort_ is not unique for an identifiable. Identifiables may have administrative information like version, etc.

Non-identifiable referable elements can be referenced. However, this requires the context of the element. A referable that is not identifiable and not child within a SubmodelElementList has a short identifier (_idShort_) that is unique just in its context, its name space.

Information about identification can be found in Clause 4.3. See Clause 4.3.4 for constraints and recommendations on when to use which type of identifier.

See Clause 4.3.4 for information about which identifier types are supported.

== Qualifier Attributes

.Metamodel of Qualifiers
image::image21.png[]

Qualifiers may be defined for qualifiable elements.

There are standardized qualifiers defined in IEC CDD, IEC61360-4 – IEC/SC 3D. A level qualifier defining the level type minimal, maximal, typical, and nominal value is specified in IEC 62569-1. In DIN SPEC 92000, qualifier types like e.g. expression semantics and expression logic are defined.

A qualifier is essentially a type-value-pair. Depending on the kind of qualifier, it makes additional statements

* w.r.t. existence and other meta information of the qualified element type.

|===

Example of a _ValueQualifier_: property "temperature" and qualifier "value quality" with different qualifier values like "measured", "substitute value".

Example of a _ConceptQualifier:_ an Asset Administration Shell with two submodels with different IDs but the same semanticId = "Bill of Material". The qualifier could denote the life cycle with qualifier values like "as planned", "as maintained" etc. (see +
Figure 21).

Example of a _TemplateQualifier:_ a submodel element with qualifier value "mandatory" or "optional". This qualification is needed to build a correct submodel instance. For more information see link:#bib48[[48\]].

== Referable Attributes

.Metamodel of Referables
image::image23.png[]

The metamodel differentiates between elements that are identifiable, referable, or none of both. The latter means they are neither inheriting from _Referable_ nor from _Identifiable_, which applies e.g. to __Qualifier__s.

Referable elements can be referenced via the _idShort_ (with exception of elements within a SubmodelElementList). For details on referencing, see Clause 5.3.9.

Not every element of the metamodel is referable. There are elements that are just attributes of a referable.

The __idShort__ shall be unique in its name space for non-identifiable referables (exception: referables within a SubmodelElementList) (see Constraint AASd-022). A name space is defined as follows in this context: the parent element(s), which an element is part of and that is either referable or identifiable, is the name space of the element. Examples: a submodel is the name space for the properties directly contained in it; the name space of a submodel element contained in a submodel element collection is the submodel element collection.
