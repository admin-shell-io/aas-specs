h|Explanation: 3+a|
The semantics of a property or other elements that may have a semantic description is defined by a concept description.

The description of the concept should follow a standardized schema (realized as data specification template).

|===

Different types of submodel elements require different attributes to describe their semantics. This is why a concept description has at least one data specification template associated with it. This template defines the attributes needed to describe the semantics.

See Clause 5.3.11.3 for predefined data specification templates.
