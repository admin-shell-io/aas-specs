include::./includes/constraints.adoc[]

== General

The change notes list the notable changes made to the document.

Non-backward compatible changes (nc) are marked as such.

* nc="x" means not backward compatible, if no value is added in the table, the change is backward compatible.

* nc="(x)" means that the change made was implicitly contained or stated in the document before and is now being formalized.
Therefore, the change is considered to be backward compatible.

The change notes for a version consist of three parts:

* changes w.r.t. previous version,
* new elements in metamodel w.r.t previous version,
* new, changed, or removed Constraints w.r.t previous version.

If there are no changes the corresponding tables are omitted.

====
Note: before V3.0, the security metamodel (now IDTA-01004) and the predefined data specifications (now IDTA-01003 series) were also part of this document. 
They had separate sections and tables documenting the changes.

== Changes V3.0 vs. V3.0RC02

Major changes:

* Document split into several documents: Part 1 on metamodel of the AAS (this document), Part 5 on the aasx package exchange format, Part 3 series on the predefined data specifications, and Part 4 (security)
* CHANGED: SubmodelElements do not inherit from HasKind any longer, only Submodel has distinction between submodel template or submodel instance (including update of tAAS-#18 and -#19)
* NEW: New Constraint for valid strings (AASd-130)
* NEW: Length constraints added for many string attributes, in most cases by introducing new string types
* CHANGED: renamed ReferenceTypes/GlobalReference to ReferenceTypes/ExternalReference (text serialization of references and constraints updated accordingly)
* CHANGED: Type of globalAsset is now Identifier and not Reference (AssetInformation and Entity)
* CHANGED: Updated text for submodel element collections
* EDITORIAL: Examples for matching references
* CHANGED: Terms and definitions updated to be conformant to IEC 63278-1 DRAFT, July 2022 (note: this document contains more terms and definitions than IEC 63278-1 and vice versa; not all terms and definitions from IEC 63278-1 are included).
Definition of view removed.
Definition of service added from Part 2.
* CHANGED: Description of ModellingKind
* NEW: Appendix for Backus-Naur form (BNF), including update of all grammars using BNF and variants for consistent grammar language usage
* ENHANCED: Extended grammar (referredSemanticId) for text serialization of <Reference>
* CHANGED: Grammar on how to define semantic identifiers for metamodel elements of this specification: <Character> definition in <Namespace> (before "an unreserved character permitted by DIN SPEC 91406", now regular expression [a..zA..Z-])
* CHANGED: In some mappings or serializations, the type "Reference" is converted into a single string.
In this case, it is now required (instead of just recommended) to use the defined string serialization.
* CHANGED: Type of BlobType changed from "group of bytes" to "base64Binary"
* NEW: Two new terms introduced: coded value and explicit value
* REMOVED: Referable/checksum
* CHANGED: EventElements including all classes introduced for Events set to \<<Experimental>>
* CHANGED: Referable/category set to \<<Deprecated>>
* CHANGED: Range set to \<<Experimental>>
* CHANGED: AdministrativeInformation Class, not data type
* NEW: New stereotype \<<Experimental>> introduced besides \<<Deprecated>>
* CHANGED: Qualifier/kind set to \<<Experimental>>
* CHANGED: enumeration DataTypeDefXsd for data types for valueType attribute (e..g. in Property) as well as enumeration DataTypeDefRdf (for consistency) + restriction to XML Schema 1.0 (not 1.1.)
* EDITORIAL (REMOVED): Clause on Tooling and Open Source
* EDITORIAL: vector graphics
* NEW: Besides type assets and instance assets now also assets for which this kind of classification is not applicable are supported (conformant to IEC 63278-1)

Bugfixes:
* Corrected Japanese example for xd:string * UML figure for HasExtensions did not show inheritance (table for Extension was correct) * HasDataSpecification/embeddedDataSpecs 0..* not 0..1 * Qualifier is and never was abstract (Constraint was), table was correct, UML corrected * Correct AASd-051: VIEW no longer supported * Type of SubmodelElementList/typeValueListElement corrected to AasSubmodelElements (before SubmodelElementElements) * Correct text serialization of <Reference> * Added missing table for enumeration ReferenceTypes * AASd-117 it is not the SubmodelElementList having no idShort but its childs * KeyTypes Table: set of AasReferables added

Smaller changes:

* EDITORIAL: Qualifier description updated
* EDITORIAL: Reformulation of constraints dealing with References and Key/type
* EDITORIAL: Examples now with https: and not http:
* EDITORIAL: Footnotes reused
* EDITORIAL: Added explanation for annotated relationship elements
* EDITORIAL: asset type and asset instance now type asset and instance asset (conformant to IEC 63278-1)
* EDITORIAL: example for langString serialization changed (table 6)

Constraint AASd-002: idShort of Referables shall only feature letters, digits, underscore ("_"); starting mandatory with a letter, i.e. [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*.

| |AASd-003 |Removed a|
See AASd-022

Constraint AASd-003: idShort of Referables within the same name space shall be unique (case-sensitive).

| |AASd-005 |Reformulated |Constraint AASd-005: If AdministrativeInformation/version is not specified, AdministrativeInformation/revision shall also be unspecified. This means that a revision requires a version. If there is no version, there is no revision. Revision is optional.
| |AASd-006 |Reformulated |Constraint AASd-006: If both, the value and the valueId of a Qualifier are present, the value needs to be identical to the value of the referenced coded value in Qualifier/valueId.
| |AASd-007 |Reformulated |Constraint AASd-007: If both the Property/value and the Property/valueId are present, the value of Property/value needs to be identical to the value of the referenced coded value in Property/valueId.
| |AASd-012 |Reformulated |Constraint AASd-012: if both the MultiLanguageProperty/value and the MultiLanguageProperty/valueId are present, the meaning must be the same for each string in a specific language, as specified in MultiLanguageProperty/valueId.
| |AASd-020 |Reformulated |Constraint AASd-020: The value of Qualifier/value shall be consistent with the data type as defined in Qualifier/valueType.
| |AASd-022 |Update a|
Added case-sensitivity for idShort (since AASd-003 was removed)

Constraint AASd-022: idShort of non-identifiable Referables within the same name space shall be unique (case-sensitive)

| |AASd-027 |Removed a|
Not needed any longer since Type of idShort was changed to NameType and NameType has a maximum length of 128 characters

Constraint AASd-027: idShort of Referables shall have a maximum length of 128 characters

| |AASd-077 |Reformulated |Constraint AASd-077: the name of an extension (Extension/name) within HasExtensions needs to be unique
| |AASd-100 |Removed a|
Since new string types with length constraints were added, this constraint is no longer needed

Constraint AASd-100: An attribute with data type "string" is not allowed to be empty

| |AASd-109 |Reformulated |Constraint AASd-109: If SubmodelElementList/typeValueListElement is equal to Property or Range, SubmodelElementList/valueTypeListElement shall be set and all first level child elements in the SubmodelElementList shall have the value type as specified in SubmodelElementList/valueTypeListElement.
| |AASd-115 |Reformulated |Constraint AASd-115: If a first level child element in a SubmodelElementList does not specify a semanticId, the value is assumed to be identical to SubmodelElementList/semanticIdListElement.
| |AASd-117 |Bugfix |Constraint AASd-117: idShort of non-identifiable Referables not being a direct child of a SubmodelElementList shall be specified.
| |AASd-118 |Reformulated |Constraint AASd-118: If a supplemental semantic ID (HasSemantics/supplementalSemanticId) is defined, there shall also be a main semantic ID (HasSemantics/semanticId).
| |AASd-119 |Reformulated |Constraint AASd-119: If any Qualifier/kind value of a Qualifiable/qualifier is equal to TemplateQualifier and the qualified element inherits from "hasKind", the qualified element shall be of kind Template (HasKind/kind = "Template").
| |AASd-120 |Reformulated |Constraint AASd-120: idShort of submodel elements being a direct child of a SubmodelElementList shall not be specified.
| |AASd-121 |Reformulated |Constraint AASd-121: For References the value of Key/type of the first key of Reference/keys shall be one of GloballyIdentifiables.
| |AASd-122 |Reformulated |Constraint AASd-122: For external references, i.e. References with Reference/type = ExternalReference, the value of Key/type of the first key of Reference/keys shall be one of GenericGloballyIdentifiables.
| |AASd-123 |Reformulated |Constraint AASd-123: For model references, i.e. References with Reference/type = ModelReference, the value of Key/type of the first key of Reference/keys shall be one of AasIdentifiables.
| |AASd-124 |Reformulated |Constraint AASd-124: For external references, i.e. References with Reference/type = ExternalReference, the last key of Reference/keys shall be either one of GenericGloballyIdentifiables or one of GenericFragmentKeys.
| |AASd-125 |Reformulated |Constraint AASd-125: For model references, i.e. References with Reference/type = ModelReference with more than one key in Reference/keys, the value of Key/type of each of the keys following the first key of Reference/keys shall be one of FragmentKeys.
| |AASd-126 |Reformulated |Constraint AASd-126: For model references, i.e. References with Reference/type = ModelReference with more than one key in Reference/keys, the value of Key/type of the last Key in the reference key chain may be one of GenericFragmentKeys, or no key at all shall have a value out of GenericFragmentKeys.
| |AASd-127 |Reformulated |Constraint AASd-127: For model references, i.e. References with Reference/type = ModelReference with more than one key in Reference/keys, a key with Key/type FragmentReference shall be preceded by a key with Key/type File or Blob. All other AAS fragments, i.e. Key/type values out of AasSubmodelElements, do not support fragments.
| |AASd-129 |New a|
Necessary as supplement for AASd-119, since SubmodelElement does not inherit from HasKind any longer

Constraint AASd-129: If any Qualifier/kind value of a SubmodelElement/qualifier (attribute qualifier inherited via Qualifiable) is equal to TemplateQualifier, the submodel element shall be part of a submodel template, i.e. a Submodel with Submodel/kind (attribute kind inherited via HasKind) value to Template.

|x |AASd-130 |New a|
Ensures that encoding is possible and interoperability between different serializations is possible.

Constraint AASd-130: An attribute with data type "string" shall consist of these characters only: ^[\x09\x0A\x0D\x20-\uD7FF\uE000-\uFFFD\u00010000-\u0010FFFF]*$.

|(x) |AASd-134 |New |Constraint AASd-134: For an operation, the idShort of all inputVariable/value, outputVariable/value, and inoutputVariable/value shall be unique.
| |AASd-051 |Removed a|
Since category is deprecated, this constraint was removed.

Views are no longer supported by metamodel

Constraint AASd-051: A _ConceptDescription_ shall have one of the following categories: VALUE, PROPERTY, REFERENCE, DOCUMENT, CAPABILITY, RELATIONSHIP, COLLECTION, FUNCTION, EVENT, ENTITY, APPLICATION_CLASS, QUALIFIER. Default: PROPERTY.

Constraint AASd-001: In case of a referable element not being an identifiable element this ID is mandatory and used for referring to the element in its name space.

For namespace part see AASd-022

|footnote:[Every model valid for V3.0RC02 is still valid in V3.0RC01, however there might be implementations that need to be changed if they assumed that the user can type case-insensitive names and get all elements that match the name in a case-insensitive way.] |AASd-003 |Update a|
idShort is case-sensitive and not case-insensitive

Constraint AASd-003: _idShort_ of _Referables_ shall be matched case-sensitive.

| |AASd-005 |Reformulated |Constraint AASd-005: If _AdministrativeInformation_/version is not specified than also _AdministrativeInformation/revision_ shall be unspecified. This means, a revision requires a version. if there is no version there is no revision neither. Revision is optional.

| |AASd-014 |Reformulated a|
Entity was changed

Constraint AASd-014: Either the attribute _globalAssetId_ or _specificAssetId_ of an _Entity_ must be set if _Entity/entityType_ is set to "_SelfManagedEntity_". They are not existing otherwise.

|(x) |AASd-020 |New |Constraint AASd-020: The value of Property/_value_ shall be consistent to the data type as defined in Property/_valueType_.
|(x) |AASd-021 |New |Constraint AASd-021: Every qualifiable can only have one qualifier with the same _Qualifier/type._
| |AASd-023 |Removed a|
No Asset any longer that can be referenced as alternative to global reference

Constraint AASd-023: AssetInformation/globalAssetId either is a reference to an Asset object or a global reference.

|x |AASd-027 |New |Constraint AASd-027: _idShort_ of _Referables_ shall have a maximum length of 128 characters.
|x |AASd-076 |Removed |Substituted by AASc-002; simplified, no reference to concept description
