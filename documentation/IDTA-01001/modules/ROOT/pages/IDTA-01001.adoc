== The Information Metamodel of the Asset Administration Shell (normative)

=== Introduction

This clause specifies the information metamodel of the Asset Administration Shell.

An overview of the metamodel of the Asset Administration Shell is given in Subclause 5.1; Subclause 5.3 describes the classes and all their attributes in detail.

The legend of the UML diagrams and the table specification of the classes is explained in Annex D and Annex E. Readers familiar with UML may skip the first clause in Annex E. It is however recommended to have a look at the specifics used in this modelling, especially those on dealing with model references.


====
Note: an xmi representation of the UML model can be found in the repository "aas-specs" in the github project admin-shell-io *link:#bib51[[51\]]*: https://github.com/admin-shell-io/aas-specs/tree/master/schemas/xmi
====


=== Overview Metamodel of the Asset Administration Shell

This clause gives an overview of the main classes of the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) metamodel.

Figure 10 shows the main classes to describe a single Asset Administration Shell.

An Asset Administration Shell represents exactly one asset (_AssetAdministrationShell/assetInformation_). Type assets and instance assets are distinguished by the attribute "_AssetInformation/assetKind_". See Clause 5.3.4 for details.


====
Note: the UML modelling uses so-called abstract classes for denoting reused concepts like "HasSemantics", "Qualifiable" etc.
====


In case of an Asset Administration Shell of an instance asset, a reference to the Asset Administration Shell representing the corresponding type asset or another instance asset it was derived from may be added (_AssetAdministrationShell/derivedFrom_). The same holds true for the Asset Administration Shell of an type asset. Types can also be derived from other types.

.Overview Metamodel of the Asset Administration Shell
image::image11.png[]

An asset may typically be represented by several different identification properties like the serial number, the manufacturer part ID or the different customer part IDs, its RFID code, etc. Such external identifiers are defined as specific asset IDs, each characterized by a user-defined name, a value, and the user domain (tenant, subject in Attribute Based Access Control; _AssetInformation/specificAssetId_). See Clause 5.3.4 for details. Additionally, a global asset identifier should be assigned to the asset (_AssetInformation/globalAssetId_) in the production and operation phase.

Asset Administration Shells, submodels and concept descriptions need to be globally uniquely identifiable (_Identifiable_). Other elements like properties only need to be referable within the model and thus only require a local identifier (_idShort_ from _Referable_). For details on identification, see Clause 4.3; details on _Identifiable_ and _Referable_ are provided in Clause 5.3.2.7 and Clause 5.3.2.10.

__Submodel__s consist of a set of submodel elements. Submodel elements may be qualified by a so-called _Qualifier_. There might be more than one qualifier per _Qualifiable_. See Clause 5.3.2.8 and Clause 5.3.2.9 for details.

There are different subtypes of submodel elements like properties, operations, lists, etc. See Clause 5.3.7 for details. A typical submodel element is shown in the overview figure: a property is a data element that has a value of simple type like string, date, etc. Every data element is a submodel element (not visible in the figure but implicitly the case, since _DataElement_ is inheriting from _SubmodelElement_). For details on properties, see Clause 5.3.7.12.

Every submodel element needs a semantic definition _(semanticId_ in _HasSemantics_) to have a well-defined meaning. The submodel element might either refer directly to a corresponding semantic definition provided by an external reference (e.g. to an ECLASS or IEC CDD property definition) or it may indirectly reference a concept description (_ConceptDescription_). See Clause 4.4.1 for matching strategies, and Clause 5.3.2.6 for details.

A concept description may be derived from another property definition of an external standard or another concept description (_ConceptDescription/isCaseOf_). _isCaseOf_ is a more formal definition of _sourceOfDefinition_, which is just text.


====
Note: in this case, most of the attributes are redundant because they are defined in the external standard. Attributes for information like _preferredName_, _unit_ etc. are added to increase usability. Consistency w.r.t. the referenced submodel element definitions should be ensured by corresponding tooling.
====


If a concept description is not just a copy or refinement of an external standard, the provider of the Asset Administration Shell using this concept description shall be aware that an interoperability with other Asset Administration Shells cannot be ensured.

Data specification templates (_DataSpecification_) can be used to define a named set of additional attributes (besides those predefined by the metamodel) for an element. The data specification template following IEC 61360 is typically used for the concept description of properties, providing e.g. an attribute "preferredName". The _\<<template>>_ dependency is used to denote recommended data specification templates. See Clause 5.3.2.2 for details.

Data specification templates like the template for IEC 61360 property definitions (Part 3a) are explicitly predefined and recommended to be used by Plattform Industrie 4.0. See Clause 6 for details. If proprietary templates are used, interoperability with other Asset Administration Shells cannot be ensured.

Besides submodel elements including properties and concept descriptions, other identifiable elements may also use additional templates (_HasDataSpecification_). Data specification templates are selected at design time. Further details are provided in Clause 6.

Figure 12 gives a complete overview of all elements defined in the metamodel and specified in Clause 5.3. The UML packages reflect the structure of Clause 5.3. The elements of package "Core" are specified as first class citizens in Clause 5.3, except for their imported packages: the elements of package "SubmodelElements" are specified in Clause 5.3.6. Elements of package "Common" are specified in Clause 5.3.2. The elements of package "Reference" are specified in Clause 5.3.10. Elements from package "Types" are specified in Clause 5.3.11. The only package that is not listed is "Data Specifications (Templates)" because data specifications are handled differently. Data specification templates are explained in Clause 6.


====
Note: the abstract classes are numbered h0_, h1_, etc. (e.g. h1_Referable); their aliases however are defined without this prefix. The reason for this naming is that no order for inherited classes can be defined in the tooling used for UML modelling (Enterprise Architect), since they are ordered alphabetically. The order is important for some serializations (e.g. for XML).
====


Figure 11 shows the so-called environment. The environment’s purpose is to list all Asset Administration Shells, all submodels, and all concept descriptions – in other word, all identifiables within an ecosystem.

=== Metamodel Specification Details: Designators

==== General

This clause specifies the classes of the metamodel in detail. An overview is provided in Clause 5.2. Annex E explains UML modelling together with the specifics used in this specification. Annex D depicts the templates used to describe the classes and relationships. Annex G shows some of the diagrams together with all their inherited attributes to give a complete overview.

To understand the specifications, it is crucial to understand the common attributes first (Clause 5.3.2). They are reused throughout the specifications of the other classes ("inherits from") and define important concepts like identifiable, qualifiable, etc. They are abstract, i.e. there is no object instance of such classes.

The concept of referencing and how a reference is represented in the UML diagrams and the tables is explained in Clause 5.3.9 and Annex E.

Constraints that are no invariants of classes are specified in Clause 5.3.11.3.

==== Common Attributes

===== General

This clause specifies the abstract classes that represent commonly used attributes and terminology, together with the classes and data types exclusively used in these classes. They are represented in alphabetical order.

===== Administrative Information Attributes

.Metamodel of Administrative Information
image::image14.png[]

Every identifiable may contain administrative information. Administrative information includes, for example,

* information about the version of the element,
* information about who created or who made the last change to the element,
* information about the languages available in case the element contains text; the master or default language may also be defined for translating purposes,
* information about the submodel template that guides the creation of the submodel

In principle, the version corresponds to the _version_identifier_ according to IEC 62832. However, it is not used for concept identifiers only (IEC TS 62832-1), but for all identifiable elements. Together, version and revision correspond to the version number according to IEC 62832.

Other attributes of the administrative information like creator refer to ISO 15836-1:2017, the Dublin Core metadata element set.

For more information on the concept of subject, see Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) link:#bib49[[49\]]. The assumption is that every subject has a unique identifier.


xref:AdministrativeInformation[AdministrativeInformation] allows the usage of templates (xref:HasDataSpecification[HasDataSpecification]). Data specifications are defined in separate documents.


====
Note 1: two submodels with the same semanticId but different administrative information shall have different IDs (_Submodel/id_), since they denote that the submodel is not backward compatible or has some other major administrative changes. The _idShort_ typically does not change. The same applies to other identifiables (_Identifiable/id_). Otherwise, the ID of a submodel would not be sufficient to identify the data or service provided by the submodel.
====



====
Note 2: since submodels with different versions shall have different identifiers, it is possible that an Asset Administration Shell has two submodels with the same _semanticId_ but different versions, i.e. different administrative metainformation.
====



====
Note 3: some of the administrative information like the version number might need to be part of the identification. This is similar to the handling of identifiers for concept descriptions using IRDIs. In ECLASS, the IRDI 0173-1#02-AO677#002 contains the version information #002.
====



====
Note 4: the process of versioning or adding other administrative information to elements is done by external version or configuration management software and not by the Asset Administration Shell itself.

===== Identifiable Attributes

.Metamodel of Identifiables
image::image19.png[]

An identifiable element is a referable with a globally unique identifier (_Identifier_). Only the global ID (_Identifiable/id_) shall be used to reference an identifiable, because the _idShort_ is not unique for an identifiable. Identifiables may have administrative information like version, etc.

Non-identifiable referable elements can be referenced. However, this requires the context of the element. A referable that is not identifiable and not child within a SubmodelElementList has a short identifier (_idShort_) that is unique just in its context, its name space.

Information about identification can be found in Clause 4.3. See Clause 4.3.4 for constraints and recommendations on when to use which type of identifier.

See Clause 4.3.4 for information about which identifier types are supported.

===== Qualifier Attributes

.Metamodel of Qualifiers
image::image21.png[]

Qualifiers may be defined for qualifiable elements.

There are standardized qualifiers defined in IEC CDD, IEC61360-4 – IEC/SC 3D. A level qualifier defining the level type minimal, maximal, typical, and nominal value is specified in IEC 62569-1. In DIN SPEC 92000, qualifier types like e.g. expression semantics and expression logic are defined.

h|Literal h|Explanation
e|ValueQualifier a|
Qualifies the value of the element; the corresponding qualifier value can change over time.

Value qualifiers are only applicable to elements with __kind__="_Instance"._

e|ConceptQualifier |Qualifies the semantic definition (_HasSemantics/semanticId_) the element is referring to; the corresponding qualifier value is static.
e|TemplateQualifier a|
Qualifies the elements within a specific submodel on concept level; the corresponding qualifier value is static.


====
Note: template qualifiers are only applicable to elements with kind="Template". See constraint AASd-129.
====


|===

Example of a _ValueQualifier_: property "temperature" and qualifier "value quality" with different qualifier values like "measured", "substitute value".

Example of a _ConceptQualifier:_ an Asset Administration Shell with two submodels with different IDs but the same semanticId = "Bill of Material". The qualifier could denote the life cycle with qualifier values like "as planned", "as maintained" etc. (see +
Figure 21).

Example of a _TemplateQualifier:_ a submodel element with qualifier value "mandatory" or "optional". This qualification is needed to build a correct submodel instance. For more information see link:#bib48[[48\]].

===== Referable Attributes

.Metamodel of Referables
image::image23.png[]

The metamodel differentiates between elements that are identifiable, referable, or none of both. The latter means they are neither inheriting from _Referable_ nor from _Identifiable_, which applies e.g. to __Qualifier__s.

Referable elements can be referenced via the _idShort_ (with exception of elements within a SubmodelElementList). For details on referencing, see Clause 5.3.9.

Not every element of the metamodel is referable. There are elements that are just attributes of a referable.

The __idShort__ shall be unique in its name space for non-identifiable referables (exception: referables within a SubmodelElementList) (see Constraint AASd-022). A name space is defined as follows in this context: the parent element(s), which an element is part of and that is either referable or identifiable, is the name space of the element. Examples: a submodel is the name space for the properties directly contained in it; the name space of a submodel element contained in a submodel element collection is the submodel element collection.

==== Asset Administration Shell Attributes

.Metamodel of an AssetAdministrationShell
image::image24.png[]

An Administration Shell is uniquely identifiable since it inherits from _Identifiable_.

The _derivedFrom_ attribute is used to establish a relationship between two Asset Administration Shells that are derived from each other. For more detailed information on the _derivedFrom_ concept, see Clause 4.2.

In _AssetInformation,_ identifying meta data of the asset that is represented by an Asset Administration Shell is defined.

The asset may either represent a type asset or an instance asset.

The asset has a globally unique identifier, plus – if needed – additional domain-specific (proprietary) identifiers. However, to support the corner case of very first phase of life cycle where a stabilized/constant global asset identifier does not already exist, the corresponding attribute "globalAssetId" is optional.

==== Submodel Attributes

.Metamodel of Submodel
image::image26.png[]

Adding a _semanticId_ for a submodel is recommended (see Table 2).

If the submodel is of _kind=Template_ (modelling kind as inherited by _HasKind_), the submodel elements within the submodel are presenting submodel element templates. If the submodel is of _kind=Instance_, its submodel elements represent submodel element instances.


====
Note: validators shall handle a submodel like _SubmodelElementCollection/submodelElements_ and not like a _SubmodelElementList/value_. The difference is that a submodel is identifiable and a predefined unit of information within the Asset Administration Shell.

h|Explanation: 3+a|
A submodel defines a specific aspect of the asset represented by the Asset Administration Shell.

A submodel is used to structure the digital representation and technical functionality of an Administration Shell into distinguishable parts. Each submodel refers to a well-defined domain or subject matter. Submodels can become standardized and, in turn, submodel templates.

.Metamodel of Submodel Element
image::image27.png[]

Submodel elements are qualifiable elements, i.e. one or more qualifiers may be defined for each of them.

It is recommended to add a _semanticId_ to a _SubmodelElement._

Submodel elements may also have defined data specification templates. A template might be defined to mirror some of the attributes like _preferredName_ and _unit_ of a property concept definition if there is no corresponding concept description available. Otherwise, there is only the property definition referenced by _semanticId_ available for the property; the attributes must be looked up online in a different way and are not available offline.

Submodel elements include data properties as well as operations, events and other elements needed to describe a model for an asset (see Figure 27).

===== General

All submodel elements including abstract classes like data elements are specified in alphabetical order.

===== Annotated Relationship Element Attributes

.Metamodel of Annotated Relationship Elements
image::image29.png[]

An annotated relationship is a relationship similar to a ternary association in UML. The semantics of the relationship is defined via the _semanticId_ of the _RelationshipElement_. If this semantic definition requires additional information not contained in the _first_ or _second_ object referenced via the relationship, this information needs to be stored as annotation.

===== Submodel Element Collection Attributes

.Metamodel of Submodel Element Collections
image::image44.png[]

Submodel Element Collections are used for complex elements with a typically fixed set of properties with unique names. This set of properties is typically predefined by the semantic definition (referenced via _semanticId_) of the submodel element collection. Each property within the collection itself should have clearly defined semantics.


====
Note: the different elements of a submodel element collection do not have to have different __semanticId__s. However, in these cases the usage of a _SubmodelElementList_ should be considered.
====


Example: a single document has a predefined set of properties like title, version, author, etc. They logically belong to a document. So a single document is represented by a _SubmodelElementCollection_. An asset usually has many different documents available like operating instructions, safety instructions, etc. The set of all documents is represented by a _SubmodelElementList_ (see Clause _5.3.7.17)_. In this case, we have a _SubmodelElementList_ of __SubmodelElementCollection__s.


====
Note: the elements within a submodel element collection are not ordered. Every element has a unique ID (its "idShort"). However, it is recommended to adhere to the order defined in the submodel template.

===== Submodel Element List Attributes

.Metamodel of Submodel Element Lists
image::image45.png[]

Submodel element lists are used for sets (i.e. unordered collections without duplicates), ordered lists (i.e. ordered collections that may contain duplicates), bags (i.e. unordered collections that may contain duplicates), and ordered sets (i.e. ordered collections without duplicates).


====
Note: there is no _idShort_ for submodel elements in lists (see Constraint AASd-120).
====


Submodel element lists are also used to create multi-dimensional arrays. A two-dimensional array listlink:#bib3[[3\]]link:#bib5[[5\]] with _Property_ values would be realized like follows: the first submodel element list would contain three _SubmodelElementList_ elements. Each of these three _SubmodelElementLists_ would contain 5 single _Property_ elements. The _semanticId_ of the contained properties would be the same for all lists in the first list, i.e. _semanticIdListElement_ would be identical for all three lists contained in the first list. The _semanticId_ of the three contained lists would differ depending on the dimension it represents. In case of complex values in the array, a _SubmodelElementCollection_ would be used as values in the leaf lists.

Similarly, a table with three columns can be represented. In this case a _SubmodelElementCollection_ with three _SubmodelElementLists_ would be contained and the _semanticId_ as well as the _semanticIdListElement_ for the three columns would differ.

Matching strategies for semantic IDs are explained in Clause 4.4.1.

The semantics of a property or other elements that may have a semantic description is defined by a concept description.

The description of the concept should follow a standardized schema (realized as data specification template).

Different types of submodel elements require different attributes to describe their semantics. This is why a concept description has at least one data specification template associated with it. This template defines the attributes needed to describe the semantics.

==== Referencing in Asset Administration Shells

===== Overview

To date, two kinds of references are distinguished: references to external objects or entities (external reference) and references to model elements of the same or another Asset Administration Shell (model reference). Model references are also used for metamodel inherent relationships like submodels of an Asset Administration Shell (notation see Annex A).

An external reference is a unique identifier. The identifier can be a concatenation of different identifiers, representing e.g. an IRDI path.


====
Note: references should not be mixed up with locators. Even URLs can be used as identifiers and do not necessarily describe a resource that can be accessed.
====


=====  Reference Attributes

h|Class: 3+e|[[Reference]]Reference
h|Explanation: 3+a|
Reference to either a model element of the same or another Asset Administration Shell or to an external entity

A model reference is an ordered list of keys, each key referencing an element. The complete list of keys may, for example, be concatenated to a path that gives unique access to an element.

An external reference is a reference to an external entity.

If _Key/type = GlobalReference,_ the key represents a reference to a source that can be globally identified.

If _Key/type = FragmentReference,_ the key represents a bookmark or a similar local identifier within its parent element as specified by the key that precedes this key.

In all other cases, the key references a model element of the same or another Asset Administration Shell. The name of the model element is explicitly listed.

In the following examples for valid und invalid model references and external references are given.
The notation follows the grammar as defined in Clause xref:#_serialization_of_values_of_type_reference[].

*(Submodel)\https://example.com/aas/1/1/1234859590, (SubmodelElementCollection)Manual, (MultiLanguageProperty)Title*


====
Note: *(SubmodelElementCollection)0, (MultiLanguageProperty)Title* may be identical to 
*(SubmodelElementCollection)Manual, (MultiLanguageProperty)Title* semantically and content-wise. 
The difference is that more than one document is allowed in the first submodel and thus a submodel element list is defined: 
elements in a list are numbered. However, it is also possible to define a display name in this case. 
The display name of the SubmodelElementCollection should be the same in both bases, e.g. "Users Manual".
====


*(Submodel)\https://example.com/aas/1/1/1234859590, (File)Specification, (FragmentReference)Hints*


====
Note: assuming the file has the value using the absolute path \https://example.com/specification.html (and not a relative path), the first reference points to the same information as the global reference (GlobalReference\https://example.com/specification.html, (FragmentReference)Hints__.__
====


*(Submodel)\https://example.com/aas/1/1/1234859590, (Blob)Specification, (FragmentReference)Hints*



[.underline]#Examples for invalid model references:#

*(GlobalReference)\https://example.com/aas/1/1/1234859590*

This is an external reference but no model reference.

*(Property)0173-1#02-BAA120#008*

This reference does not start with the ID of an Identiable. Additionally the value is not valid idShort for a Property submodel element.

*(Submodel)\https://example.com/aas/1/1/1234859590, (EventElement)Event, (FragmentReference)Comment*

This model reference is invalid because fragment references so far are only defined for _File_ and _Blob_ submodel elements (see Constraint AASd-127, xref:AASd-127).

*(AssetAdministrationShell)\https://example.com/aas/1/0/12348, +
(Submodel)\https://example.com/aas/1/1/1234859590, (Property)Temperature*

This is not a valid model reference because _AssetAdministrationShell_ and _Submodel_ are both global identifiables.

==== Primitive and Simple Data Types

===== Predefined Simple Data Types

The metamodel of the Asset Administration Shell uses basic data types as defined in the link:https://www.w3.org/XML/Core/[XML Schema Definition] (XSD)footnote:[https://www.w3.org/XML/Core/, former https://www.w3.org/XML/Schema]. See Table 7 for an overview of the used types. Their definition is outside the scope of this document.

The meaning and format of xsd types is specified in https://www.w3.org/XML/Schema. The simple type "langString" is specified in the Resource Description Framework (RDF)footnote:[see: https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/].

See Clause 5.3.12.6 for constraints on types.

===== Enumeration for Submodel Element Value Types

Enumerations are primitive data types. Most of the enumerations are defined in the context of their class. This clause defines enumerations for submodel element value typesfootnote:[E.g. Property/valueType].

The predefined types used to define the type of values of properties and other values use the names and the semantics of XML Schema Definition (XSD)footnote:[see https://www.w3.org/XML/Schema, https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#built-in-primitive-datatypes]. Additionally, the type "langString" with the semantics as defined in the Resource Description Framework (RDF)footnote:[see: https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/] is used. "langString" is a string value tagged with a language code.


====
Note 1: RDFfootnote:[See https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#xsd-datatypes] recommends to not use the following xsd data types. That is why they are excluded from the allowed data types.
====


* XSD BuildIn List types are not supported (ENTITIES, IDREFS and NMTOKENS).
* XSD string BuildIn types are not supported (normalizedString, token, language, NCName, ENTITY, ID, IDREF).
* The following XSD primitive types are not supported: NOTATION, QName.


====
Note 2: the following RDF types are not supported: HTML and XMLLiteral.

The enumeration is derived from Figure 54.

.Data TypeDefXsd Enumeration

Table 9 depicts example values and the value range of the different data type"

shows the data types which can be used for submodel element values. The data types are defined according to the W3C XML Schema (https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#built-in-datatypes and https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#built-in-derived). "Value Range" further explains the possible range of data values for this data type. The right column shows related examples for values of the corresponding data type.

RDF requires IETF BCP 47footnote:[see https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt] language tags. Simple two-letter language tags for locales like "de" conformant to ISO 639-1 are allowed, as well as language tags plus extension like "de-DE" for country code, dialect, etc. like in "en-US" for English (United States) or "en-GB" for English (United Kingdom). IETF language tags are referencing ISO 639, ISO 3166 and ISO 15924.

====  Constraints: Global Invariants

===== Introduction

This clause documents constraints that represent global invariants, i.e. constraints that cannot be assigned to a single class.

In contrast, a class invariant is a constraint that must be true for all instances of a class at any time. They are documented as part of the class specification.

===== Constraints for Referables and Identifiables

{aasd117}


====
Note: in other words (AASd-117), __idShort__ is mandatory for all __Referable__s except for referables being direct childs of __SubmodelElementList__s and for all __Identifiable__s.
====


{aasd120}

{aasd022}


====
Note: AASd-022 also means that __idShort__s of referables shall be matched sensitive to the case.
====


===== Constraints for Qualifiers

{aasd021}

{aasd119}

{aasd129}

===== Constraints for Extensions

{aasd077}

===== Constraints for Asset-Related Information

{aasd116}


====
Note: AASd-116 is important to enable a generic search across global and specific asset IDs.
====

====
Note: The semanticId of a SpecificAssetId with the predefined name "gloablAssetId" corresponds to the metamodel attribute "https://admin-shell-io/aas/3/1/AssetInformation/globalAssetId"
====

===== Constraints for Types

{aasd130}

Constraint AASd-130 ensures that encoding and interoperability between different serializations is possible. It corresponds to the restrictions as defined for the XML Schema 1.0footnote:[https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#charsets].
