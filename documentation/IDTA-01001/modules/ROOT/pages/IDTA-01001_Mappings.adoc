== Data Format for Sharing Data (normative)

=== Technical Data Formats

It is crucial for Industry 4.0 applications to share information between different systems throughout the areas covered by the entire RAMI4.0 model link:#bib1[[1\]] link:#bib2[[2\]]. OPC UA is a frequently used format for information models in the domain of production operations, but there is a need for other formats for further areas and the relationships between them.

This document specifies the Asset Administration Shell in a technology-neutral format, UML. Different data formats are used or recommended to be used in the different life cycle phases of a productfootnote:[The word “data formats” is used as shortcut and includes the use of conceptual advantages such as information models, schemes, transmission protocols, etc.]. Serializations and mappings of the Asset Administration Shell are provided to cover the complete life cycle of each of these formats. Figure 57.

Table 10 explains the main purpose of each of the formats: OPC UA information modelsfootnote:[OPC UA Information Models should not be mixed up with the Client/Server or Pub/Sub Protocol of OPC UA. This would belong to the communication but not to the Asset Administration Shell representation layer.], AutomationML, XML, JSON, and RDF. The different purposes are visualized in Figure 57.

=== Content Format Types

For different use case scenarios different formats are suitable to fulfill the needs.
Besides technical formats like JSON and XML also different content formats are available.


.Format Types
[%autowidth, width="100%", cols="29%,71%",options="header",]
|===
|*Format* |*Explanation*
|Normal a|The standard serialization of the model element or child elements is applied.

|Metadata a|Only metadata of an element or child elements is returned; the value is not.

|Value a|Only the raw value of the model element or child elements is returned; it is commonly referred to as _ValueOnly_-serialization.

|Reference |Only applicable to Referables. Only the reference to the found element is returned; potential child elements are ignored.

|Path a|Returns the idShort of the requested element and a list of _idShort_ paths to child elements if the requested element is a Submodel, a SubmodelElementCollection, a SubmodelElementList, a AnnotatedRelationshipElement, or an Entity.

===  Encoding

Blobs require the following encoding: base64 string.


===  Serialization of Values of Type "Reference"

include::./IDTA-01001_MetaDataObjects.adoc[]

include::IDTA-01001_ValueOnly.adoc[]

include::IDTA-01001_idShortPath.adoc[]

=== Format "Reference"

In some use cases only the (model) reference to the object is needed in the first place.

References are possible for Referables, only. Potential child elements are ignored.

For references see Clause xref:#_referencing_in_asset_administration_shells[].

.Format "Reference" - Example in JSON
[source,json,linenums]
----
        "keys": [
          {
            "type": "AssetAdministrationShell",
            "value": "urn:an-example08:f3f73640"
          }
        ],
        "type": "ModelReference"
      }

=== Format "Normal" in  XML

The metamodel of an Asset Administration Shell needs to be serialized for import and export scenarios. XML is a possible serialization format.

eXtensible Markup Language (XMLfootnote:[see: https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/]) is very well suited to derive information from an IT system, e.g. to process it manually and then feed it into another IT system. It meets the needs of the information sharing scenario defined in the leading picture in Clause 4.1. XML provides the possibilities of scheme definitions, which can be used to syntactically validate the represented information in each step.

===  Format "Normal" in JSON

JSONfootnote:[see: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259 or https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-404.htm] (JavaScript Object Notation) is a further serialization format that serializes the metamodel of an Asset Administration Shell for import and export scenarios.

Additionally, JSON format is used to describe the payload in the http/REST API for active Asset Administration Shells link:#bib37[[37\]].

===  Format "Normal" in RDF

The Resource Description Framework (RDF) link:#bib32[[32\]] is the recommended standard of the W3C to unambiguously model and present semantic data. RDF documents are structured in the form of triples, consisting of subjects, relations, and objects. The resulting model is often interpreted as a graph, with the subject and object elements as the nodes and the relations as the graph edges.

RDF is closely related to web standards, illustrated by the fact that all elements are encoded using (HTTP-)IRIs. As a common practice, the provision of additional information at the referenced location of an RDF entity directly allows the interlinking of entitiesfootnote:[Note: entity as a generic term and entity as a specific submodel element subtype need tobe distinugished.] based on the web. This process – following links in order to discover related information – is called dereferencing a resource and is supported by any browser or web client. Connecting distributed data sources through the web in the described manner is referred to by the term “Linked Data”. Connecting the available resources and capabilities of linked data with the expressiveness of the Asset Administration Shell is one motivation for the RDF serialization.

In addition, RDF is the basis of a wide range of logical inference and reasoning techniques. Vocabularies like RDF Schema (RDFS) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL) combine the graph-based syntax of RDF with formal definitions and axioms. This allows automated reasoners to understand the relation between entities to some extent and draw conclusions.

Combining both features, the RDF mapping of the Asset Administration Shell can provide the basis for complex queries and requests. SPARQL, the standard query language for the Semantic Web, can combine reasoning features with the integration of external data sources. In order to benefit of these abilities, the Asset Administration Shell requires a clear scheme of its RDF representation.

===  Format "Normal" in AutomationML

AutomationML (IEC 62714) is especially suited for serializing the import and export scenarios of the metamodel of an Asset Administration Shell in the engineering phase.

In general, the serialization approach is to map each object of the Asset Administration Shell metamodel to an AutomationML Role Class or to an AutomationML Role Class accompanied by an AutomationML Interface Class. This role class and (if applied) interface class also define the required attributes in AutomationML.

Asset Administration Shells themselves shall be modelled as AutomationML System Unit Classes or as Internal Elements within an Instance Hierarchy depending of the kind information of type and instance.

For the role classes and interface classes that are required for serialization, an AutomationML Role Class Library resp. an Interface Class Library are defined and provided to the public.

One of the goals is to ensure that the AutomationML model of the Asset Administration Shell can be used as a stand-alone AutomationML model, as well as in combination with existing AutomationML models such as the upcoming AutomationML Component Description. Therefore, the definition of the serialization approach defined in this clause is incorporated with the AutomationML definitions and applies the AutomationML technology definitions available on https://www.automationml.org/o.red.c/dateien.html.

link:#bib28[[28\]] is the AutomationML application recommendation for the Asset Administration Shell (AR AAS).

===  Format "Normal" in OPC UA

OPC UA is suited for the operating phase of Asset Administration Shellsfootnote:[OPC UA is used for several purposes in the context of Industry 4.0. In this document, however, the focus is on Asset Administration Shell representation only.] and especially applicable in case of machine-to-machine communication. The information model link:#bib42[[42\]] is the basis for the definition of so-called OPC UA Information Models, or OPC UA Companion Specifications link:#bib43[[43\]].

Note1 : the mapping to the OPC UA are carried out in a joint working groupfootnote:[see: https://opcfoundation.org/collaboration/i4aas/] "I4AAS" between OPC Foundation, ZVEI and VDMA (https://opcfoundation.org/markets-collaboration/I4AAS/ link:#bib30[[30\]].
