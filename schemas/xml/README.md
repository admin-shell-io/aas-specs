# XML

Extensible Markup Language ([XML]) is a popular serialization format for data exchange and storage.
Admittedly, XML is not as widely used for client-server communication compared to other formats such as JSON.
Nevertheless, XML is still leveraged in many databases and as a file format within a rich ecosystem of accompanying validation, query and transformation tools.

[XML]: https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/

While there are many possibilities to represent a model of an Asset Administration Shell in XML, we provide our "official" XML schema definition ([XSD]) to foment interoperability between different tools and systems.

[XSD]: https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-0/

Below we explain in more detail how our schema is constructed, point the user to the examples and finally give some background information on our particular schema design.

## Top-Level Structure

The root element of our XML is an XML element representing the instance of [Environment].
This environment contains three aggregations, corresponding to all [Identifiable] classes:

* [AssetAdministrationShell]'s,
* [Submodel]'s, and
* [ConceptDescription]'s.

[Environment]: https://www.plattform-i40.de/IP/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/Publikation/Details_of_the_Asset_Administration_Shell_Part1_V3.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=10#page=82

[Identifiable]: https://www.plattform-i40.de/IP/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/Publikation/Details_of_the_Asset_Administration_Shell_Part1_V3.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=10#page=51

[AssetAdministrationShell]: https://www.plattform-i40.de/IP/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/Publikation/Details_of_the_Asset_Administration_Shell_Part1_V3.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=10#page=57

[Submodel]: https://www.plattform-i40.de/IP/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/Publikation/Details_of_the_Asset_Administration_Shell_Part1_V3.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=10#page=61

[ConceptDescription]: https://www.plattform-i40.de/IP/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/Publikation/Details_of_the_Asset_Administration_Shell_Part1_V3.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=10#page=81

To simplify exploration of the XML data, identifiable instances are only available at the level of the environment, and nowhere else.

We now continue to see how to serialize the instances and their attributes.

## Mapping Rules

Unlike for example JSON, which provides an object notations, building blocks of an XML document include only [XML elements], [XML attributes] and [text enclosed in an element].
XML elements can nest children elements.

[XML elements]: https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_elements.asp

[XML attributes]: https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_attributes.asp

[text enclosed in an element]: https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_elements.asp

We will therefore use these building blocks to map an AAS model to XML.

### Attribute ðŸ ’ XML Element

Before we look into how to represent instances of classes, let us start bottom-up and see first how individual attributes are represented.

We represent each attribute of a class with an XML element whose name corresponds to the attribute.
The name is given in camel-case where all abbreviations are left as capitalized (``dataSpecificationIec61360`` instead of ``dataSpecificationIEC61360``).

### Why no XML attributes?

While some meta-model attributes are indeed very apt to be succinctly represented as XML attributes, we decided *not* to use XML attributes at all for three reasons.

First, the XML attribute must be a string, and therefore does not allow for structured data to be represented with it.
As the meta-model evolves, we need to be able to gracefully evolve the schema with as little breakages as possible.
An XML attribute puts a limit in so far that an attribute can only be represented as string.
Moreover, as the schema evolves, making [diff]'s is important to trace the changes.
This is much harder when the attributes switch from an XML attribute to an XML element.

[diff]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff

Second, many classes contain a mix of string attributes and structured attributes.
If we allowed XML attributes, the former would be represented as XML attributes, while the latter would be represented as XML elements.
This leads to confusion where the writer is forced to go back and forth in the specification, and always double-check whether an attribute should be represented as an XML attribute or an XML element.

Third, we automatically generate the schema from a machine-readable meta-model representation (see Section [Background] below).
The mix of XML attributes and elements would have complicated the code and prolonged the development.

[Background]: #Background

We finally decided that the drawbacks outlined above outweighed the advantage in form of succinct representation.

### Cardinality

If an attribute has cardinality ``0..1`` or ``0..*`` and is not specified in the instance, the element is simply omitted.

For aggregation attributes, *i.e.* with cardinality upper bound higher than 1 such as ``0..*``, we require the respective XML elements to be given in plural form for better readability and diverge thus from the meta-model.
For example, ``submodelElements`` instead of ``submodelElement`` in case of [Submodel] class.

In cases where plural form made no sense for an attribute, we kept it as-is in singular form (*e.g.*, `isCaseOf`).

### Attribute Values of Simple Data Types

The attribute values given in the meta-model as simple data types (see Section [5.7.12 Primitive and Simple Data Types] of the meta-model) are serialized as text enclosed in the XML element corresponding to the attribute.

[5.7.12 Primitive and Simple Data Types]: https://www.plattform-i40.de/IP/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/Publikation/Details_of_the_Asset_Administration_Shell_Part1_V3.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=10#page=95

The byte arrays (``BlobType`` in meta-model) are serialized as Base64-encoded text.

Simple type ``rdf:langString`` is serialized as if it were a proper meta-model class with attributes ``language`` and ``text``.
See the following Section [Instances of Classes as Attribute Values] about how to serialize instances of classes in general as that section directly applies to ``rdf:langString``.

[Instances of Classes as Attribute Values]: #Instances-of-Classes-as-Attribute-Values

### Instances of Classes as Attribute Values

To serialize instances of meta-model classes as values of attributes, we need to nest them somehow within the XML element corresponding to the attribute.
This is not as trivial as it seems.

If the attribute type is a concrete or abstract class with descendants, the deserializer needs to know the exact concrete class at the time of de-serialization.
However, this information is obviously missing in the meta-model.
For example, the attribute [Submodel/submodelElement] tells the deserializer that its items are instances of [SubmodelElement], but the deserializer does not know which *concrete* deserialization method to apply to understand the nested XML data: is it [Property], [Range] or some other descendant of [SubmodelElement]?

[Submodel/submodelElement]: https://www.plattform-i40.de/IP/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/Publikation/Details_of_the_Asset_Administration_Shell_Part1_V3.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=10#page=61

[SubmodelElement]: https://www.plattform-i40.de/IP/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/Publikation/Details_of_the_Asset_Administration_Shell_Part1_V3.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=10#page=62

[Property]: https://www.plattform-i40.de/IP/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/Publikation/Details_of_the_Asset_Administration_Shell_Part1_V3.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=10#page=75

[Range]: https://www.plattform-i40.de/IP/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/Publikation/Details_of_the_Asset_Administration_Shell_Part1_V3.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=10#page=76

Therefore, the information about the concrete type of the serialized instance must be encoded somehow in XML when the type in the meta-model is too vague.
This nugget of information is usually called a *discriminator* (*e.g.*, see [OpenAPI 3 specification on polymorphism]).

[OpenAPI 3 specification on polymorphism]: https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/inheritance-and-polymorphism/

On the other hand, when the meta-model mandates the type of attribute as a concrete class without descendants, the deserializer needs no additional information as the deserialization method is given by the meta-model.
There is thus no need to include the discriminator in the serialization, and a redundant discriminator would only clutter the XML document.

We therefore distinguish two serializations of instances: one with discriminator, and one without, respectively.

#### Instances Serialized with Discriminator

We use the XML element named according to the concrete class at the serialization as the discriminator.
The attributes of the instance are nested below this discriminator XML element.

Let us make an example.
The example will be agnostic of the particular meta-model version, so that it can age well across different versions.
We fantasize a meta-model class `SomeAbstractClass` and assume it has two descendant classes, `SomeConcreteClass` and `AnotherConcreteClass`.
Let us assume yet another class, `YetAnotherClass`, entails the attribute `someAttribute` of type `SomeAbstractClass`.

Here is how the XML structure corresponding to `YetAnotherClass/someAttribute` would look like in this fantasized case, where the value is an instance of `SomeConcreteClass`:

```xml

<someAttribute>
    <SomeConcreteClass>
        ...
        serialized
        attributes
        of
        SomeConcreteClass
        ...
    </SomeConcreteClass>
</someAttribute>
```

If the value is an instance of `AnotherConcreteClass`, the serialization becomes:

```xml

<someAttribute>
    <AnotherConcreteClass>
        <!-- ... serialized attributes of AnotherConcreteClass ... -->
    </AnotherConcreteClass>
</someAttribute>
```

The abstract class, `SomeAbstractClass`, does not show up in the serialization at all, as it is redundant information.

#### Instances Serialized without Discriminator

If the concrete type of the attribute at deserialization is unambiguous by the meta-model, we omit the discriminator to reduce the clutter.
The instance is simply serialized as a sequence of XML elements corresponding to its attributes.

Let us fantasize yet another example, similar to the one in Section [Instances Serialized with Discriminator].
We will again draw an example such that it is agnostic of meta-model version for better evolution of this Readme.
Assume a class `SomeClass` with an attribute `SomeClass/someAttribute`.
Now imagine the type of `someAttribute` to be the class `AnotherClass`.
The class `AnotherClass` provides attributes `AnotherClass/anotherAttribute` and `AnotherClass/yetAnotherAttribute`.
The class `AnotherClass` has no descendants, so the concrete type of `SomeClass/someAttribute` is unambiguous.

[Instances Serialized with Discriminator]: #Instances-Serialized-with-Discriminator

Here is how the XML structure would look like:

```xml

<someAttribute>
    <anotherAttribute>
        <!-- ... -->
    </anotherAttribute>
    <yetAnotherAttribute>
        <!-- ... -->
    </yetAnotherAttribute>
</someAttribute>
```

The type information about `AnotherClass` is omitted, as the type of the `SomeClass/someAttribute` is fixed in the meta-model.

### Attribute Values as Aggregations

Many attributes in the meta-model do not represent a single value (be it primitive or structured as a class), but aggregate instances of meta-model classes.
For example, [Submodel/submodelElement] aggregates instances of [SubmodelElement]'s.

If we just concatenated all the properties of the instances, we would not which property belongs to which instance (or that would be complicated).
We need a delimiter!

Following the approach described in Section [Instances Serialized with Discriminator], we delimit the instances simply by nesting them beneath the discriminator elements.
If the type of the list items is a concrete class, we nest beneath the discriminator element regardless.

For example, here is an XML snippet of an example submodel elements, where the first element is a [Property], the second one is a [Range] and the third is a [Property]:

```xml

<submodel>
    <submodelElements>
        <!-- First element -->
        <property>
            <!-- ... some attributes ... -->
        </property>

        <!-- Second element -->
        <range>
            <!-- ... another attributes ... -->
        </range>

        <!-- Third element -->
        <property>
            <!-- ... yet another attributes ... -->
        </property>
    </submodelElements>
</submodel>
```

We explicitly forbid empty lists in XML to avoid confusion about attributes which have cardinality ``0..*``.
Namely, an empty list is semantically equal to an omitted attribute (according to the meta-model).
Thus, the XML element representing an aggregation attribute must be omitted if the aggregation is empty.

The following snippet is therefore invalid:

```xml

<submodel>
    <submodelElements/>
    <!-- other attributes -->
</submodel>
```

... and should be written as:

```xml

<submodel>
    <!-- other attributes -->
</submodel>
```

### Order of the Attributes

We fixed the order of the attributes to match the meta-model for readability.

This is reflected in usage of `xs:sequence` throughout the XML schema.

### Enumerations

Enumerations are serialized according to the exact values of enumeration literals in the meta-model as text.

For example, the enumeration literal [EntityType/CoManagedEntity] is serialized as ``CoManagedEntity``, while the literal [Direction/input] as ``input``.

[EntityType/CoManagedEntity]: https://www.plattform-i40.de/IP/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/Publikation/Details_of_the_Asset_Administration_Shell_Part1_V3.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=10#page=71

[Direction/input]: https://www.plattform-i40.de/IP/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/Publikation/Details_of_the_Asset_Administration_Shell_Part1_V3.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=10#page=66

### Embedded Data Specifications

There is an abstract definition of data specifications as templates in the meta-model ( see Section [6 Predefined Data Specification Templates]).
This definition does not specify, though, how to access them from within an [Environment], which is a requirement for many systems.
To address this practical issue, the meta-model indicates that they should be embedded in serializations (see Section [9.2.5 Embedded Data Specifications]).

[6 Predefined Data Specification Templates]: https://www.plattform-i40.de/IP/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/Publikation/Details_of_the_Asset_Administration_Shell_Part1_V3.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=10#page=106

[9.2.5 Embedded Data Specifications]: https://www.plattform-i40.de/IP/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/Publikation/Details_of_the_Asset_Administration_Shell_Part1_V3.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=10#page=150

We therefore add additional XML element, named `embeddedDataSpecifications`, in the XML representations of [HasDataSpecification] class, and omit `dataSpecification` attribute by design.
The embedded data specifications are serialized just as all the other classes of the meta-model, following the procedure outlined above.

[HasDataSpecification]: https://www.plattform-i40.de/IP/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/Publikation/Details_of_the_Asset_Administration_Shell_Part1_V3.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=10#page=56

### Namespace

The XML elements representing the AAS model are explicitly required to live in our namespace.
The namespace corresponds to the version of the meta-model.

For example, the serialization for the meta-model `V3.0RC02` lives in the namespace `https://admin-shell.io/aas/3/0/RC02`.

## Structure of the Schema

XML schemas tend to grow very complex, very quickly.
Our schema is no exception.
While we described so far how an XML document looks like for a concrete AAS model, let us briefly give you an overview of the schema beneath it.

At this point, we only outline its structure in broad brushes.
Please refer to the actual file [schema/xml/AAS.xsd](AAS.xsd) for more details.

For each class, we define a `xs:group` which lays out the order (as a nested `xs:sequence`) and type of the XML elements corresponding to the attributes of the class.
The inheritance is dealt by nesting an additional `xs:group` element within the sequence with the `ref` attribute.

The individual attributes are defined with `xs:element` in the `xs:sequence`.

For example:

```xml

<xs:group
        name="administrativeInformation">
    <xs:sequence>
        <xs:group
                ref="hasDataSpecification"/>
        <xs:element
                name="version"
                minOccurs="0"
                maxOccurs="1">
            <xs:simpleType>
                <xs:restriction
                        base="xs:string">
                    <xs:minLength
                            value="1"/>
                </xs:restriction>
            </xs:simpleType>
        </xs:element>
        <!-- ... More elements come here ... -->
    </xs:sequence>
</xs:group>
```

For each class, we define a `xs:complexType`, name it with an `_t` prefix and refer the complex type to the corresponding group.
The complex types are necessary so that we can use them to specify aggregations.

For example, here is the definition of `submodel_t`:

```xml

<xs:complexType
        name="submodel_t">
    <xs:sequence>
        <xs:group
                ref="submodel"/>
    </xs:sequence>
</xs:complexType>
```

Here it is used in the definition of the aggregation:

```xml

<xs:group
        name="environment">
    <!-- ... -->
    <xs:element
            name="submodels"
            minOccurs="0"
            maxOccurs="1">
        <xs:complexType>
            <xs:sequence>
                <xs:element
                        name="submodel"
                        type="submodel_t"
                        minOccurs="1"
                        maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
            </xs:sequence>
        </xs:complexType>
    </xs:element>
    <!-- ... -->
</xs:group>
```

If a class has one or more descendants, we define an `xs:group` with the `_choice` suffix.
This is necessary so that we can enforce a closed set of concrete classes at the de/serialization.
In particular, we want to ensure that the discriminator is given correctly (see Section [Instances Serialized with Discriminator]).

Here is an example of a choice:

```xml

<xs:group
        name="submodelElement_choice">
    <xs:choice>
        <!-- ... -->
        <xs:element
                name="property"
                type="property_t"/>
        <xs:element
                name="range"
                type="range_t"/>
        <!-- ... -->
    </xs:choice>
</xs:group>
```

Here the choice is enforced in another group:

```xml

<xs:group
        name="submodel">
    <xs:sequence>
        <!-- ... -->
        <xs:element
                name="submodelElements"
                minOccurs="0"
                maxOccurs="1">
            <xs:complexType>
                <xs:sequence>
                    <xs:group
                            ref="submodelElement_choice"
                            minOccurs="1"
                            maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
                </xs:sequence>
            </xs:complexType>
        </xs:element>
    </xs:sequence>
</xs:group>
```

## Examples

Examples of the XML serializations can be found in [schemas/xml/examples/](examples) folder.

## Background

### Handwritten Schema

When we started with the project, the schema had been manually written.
One or two schema designers would sit down, follow the book and translate it into XML schema by best effort.
This allowed for a lot of artistic freedom, but eventually caused problems due to mismatches with other serializations or internal inconsistencies.
Especially as the meta-model evolved, maintaining the schema and keeping it up-to-date with the meta-model proved to be difficult.

### Generated Schema

While the handwritten schema is arguably elegant, the maintenance is too demanding.
Therefore, we developed a schema generator based on the machine-readable representation of the meta-model.
The generator is provided in [aas-core-codegen] project, while the meta-model lives in [aas-core-meta].

[aas-core-meta]: https://github.com/aas-core-works/aas-core-meta

[aas-core-codegen]: https://github.com/aas-core-works/aas-core-codegen

This allowed us to evolve the XML schema more quickly while keeping it in sync with other serialization schemas and SDKs.
However, we had to give up on elegant parts of the schema, and had to straightjacket the schema into form that can be programmatically generated.
For example, all attributes are serialized as XML elements, and we could not use XML attributes.
