# XMI

This is the XMI Representation of Specification of the Asset Administration Shell - Part 1 Metamodel.
The XML Metadata Interchange ([XMI](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Metadata_Interchange)) is an Object Management Group ([OMG](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language)) standard for exchanging metadata information via Extensible Markup Language (XML).

The most common use of XMI is as an interchange format for UML models, although it can also be used for serialization of models of other languages (metamodels). 

The Enterprise Architect in Version 16.1.1628 (Build 1628) was used to generate the XMI files. Sparxsystems Enterprise Architect uses XMI as a method of importing and exporting model specifications between different UML Packages, Enterprise Architect projects and other tools that support XMI.

- The file *.ea.xmi contains the native XMI format of Enterprise Architect with [XMI version 2.1](https://www.omg.org/spec/XMI/2.1/About-XMI/).
- The file *.norm.xmi contains the [Normative XMI 2.4.2 format](https://www.omg.org/spec/XMI/2.4.2), this format does not contain figures.
