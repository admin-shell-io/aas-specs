# JSON Examples

These are randomly generated examples that fulfill the formalized semantic and syntactic constraints, 
however due to the random generation, they might not make sense.
They're best suited for testing your software.

The examples were automatically generated by [aas-core3.0-testgen].

There are two kinds of examples for each class of the meta-model:

* `minimal.json` demonstrates the minimal example, where only required properties were set.
* `maximal.json` shows a complete example, where mandatory as well as optional properties are generated.

Apart from the two examples, we also generate various additional examples for different properties based on fuzzing.
For example, see [generated/AnnotatedRelationshipElement/idShortOverPatternExamples/fuzzed\_01.json].

- [Maturity Evaluation of SDKs for I4.0 Digital Twins]
