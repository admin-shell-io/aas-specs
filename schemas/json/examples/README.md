# JSON Examples

The examples were automatically generated by [aas-core3.0-testgen].

There are two kinds of examples for each class of the meta-model:

* `minimal.json` demonstrates the minimal example, where only required properties were set.
* `maximal.json` shows a complete example, where mandatory as well as optional properties are generated.

Apart from the two examples, we also generate various additional examples for different properties based on fuzzing.
For example, see [generated/AnnotatedRelationshipElement/idShortOverPatternExamples/fuzzed\_01.json].
