# JSON

[JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)] is a popular serialization format. Beside XML and
RDF, it is an  "official" serialization format for models of Asset Administration
Shells (AAS). Since JSON is a very versatile format, there are many ways how we could
map an AAS model to it. In this document, we explore our particular design of the
serialization schema based on [JSON schema 2019-09], and explain in detail the rules how
we mapped the [AAS meta-model] to it.

## Top-Level Structure

The root of our serialization is a JSON object representing the instance
of [Environment]. This environment contains three aggregations, corresponding to
all [Identifiable] classes:

* [AssetAdministrationShell]'s,
* [Submodel]'s, and
* [ConceptDescription]'s.

[Environment]: https://industrialdigitaltwin.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IDTA-01001-3-0_SpecificationAssetAdministrationShell_Part1_Metamodel.pdf#page=80

[Identifiable]: https://industrialdigitaltwin.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IDTA-01001-3-0_SpecificationAssetAdministrationShell_Part1_Metamodel.pdf#page=52

[AssetAdministrationShell]: https://industrialdigitaltwin.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IDTA-01001-3-0_SpecificationAssetAdministrationShell_Part1_Metamodel.pdf#page=58

[Submodel]: https://industrialdigitaltwin.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IDTA-01001-3-0_SpecificationAssetAdministrationShell_Part1_Metamodel.pdf#page=62

[ConceptDescription]: https://industrialdigitaltwin.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IDTA-01001-3-0_SpecificationAssetAdministrationShell_Part1_Metamodel.pdf#page=79

The JSON properties of the environment correspond to these three aggregations.

To simplify exploration of the JSON data, identifiable instances are only available at
the level of the environment, and nowhere else.

## Mapping Rules

### Classes to JSON definitions

For each class of the [AAS meta-model], we provide [a definition] in the JSON schema.
The instances of the classes, abstract and concrete alike, are modeled as [JSON objects]
.

[a definition]: https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/structuring.html#defs

[JSON objects]: https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/object.html

### UML properties to JSON properties

The class properties of the meta-model (attributes and aggregations) correspond directly
to [JSON properties].

[JSON properties]: https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/object.html#properties

Optional attributes, *i.e.*, the attributes with the cardinality ``0..1``, are modeled
as [non-required properties].

[non-required properties]: https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/object.html#required-properties

Aggregations, *i.e.*, the properties with the cardinality ``0..*``, ``1..*`` *etc.*, are
modeled as [JSON arrays].

[JSON arrays]: https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/array.html

We explicitly forbid empty JSON arrays to avoid confusion about properties which have
cardinality ``0..*``. Namely, an empty array is semantically equal to an omitted
attribute (according to the meta-model). Thus, the JSON property representing an
aggregation attribute must be omitted if the aggregation is empty.

In UML, it is the convention to name associations and aggregations in singular form. The
cardinality is to be taken into account to decide on whether there are none, a single or
several elements in the corresponding association or aggregation. In JSON it is best
practice to use plural form for array in class properties. The singular name is used for
its descriminator (see section on decriminators). Typically the plural name is derived
by just adding an "s" to the name. For example, ``submodelElements`` instead
of ``submodelElement`` in case of [Submodel] class.

If plural form made no sense for a property, we kept it as-is (*e.g.*, `isCaseOf`). The
full list of exceptions is available [as code in aas-core-meta].

[as code in aas-core-meta]: https://github.com/aas-core-works/aas-core-meta/blob/02712deeff530a75fda99aee25961aa4ea38a420/tests/test_v3.py#L1069

### Primitive attribute values

The UML specification uses XSD types. For the [mapping of XSD to JSON types] please
refer to [Part 2 of the series of the Asset Adminsistration Shell].

There are the following exceptions:

[Property]/``value`` and [Range]/``min`` and [Range]/``max`` are mapped to a JSON
string. The type it needs to be converted to by the data consumer is declared
in [Property]/``valueType`` or [Range]/``valueType``, resp.

Primitive type [BlobType] (group of ``byte``s) is mapped to a JSON string with base64
encoding.

Note: in valueOnly Format of [Part 2 of the series of the Asset Adminsistration Shell]
value has the JSON type as declared in [Property]/``valueType`` taking
the [mapping of XSD to JSON types] into account.

#### Hint: Round-Trip Conversions

Round-trip conversions XML to JSON to XML or RDF to JSON to RDF may not result in the
original file.

The result of a model saved as XML is different to the model saved as JSON. For example,
if the user typed in `1` for a boolean UML attribute (e.g. for ``SubmodelElementList``
/``orderRelevant``)
in the editor, saved the model as JSON and opened it again, she would suddenly
see `true` instead of `1`
(since the JSON library would silently convert `1` to a [JSON boolean] `true`).

### Inheritance

The inheritance relationships between the classes are modeled using [allOf composition].
While JSON schema knows no inheritance, we enforce through ``allOf`` that all the
properties of the parent are defined in the descendants.

[allOf composition]: https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/combining.html#allof

### Discriminator

Many attributes in the meta-model refer to an abstract class. When we de-serialize such
attributes, we need to know the concrete class at runtime, since otherwise the
de-serialization algorithm would not know how to interpret the properties of the object.

For example, consider the attribute [Submodel] which contains instances
of [SubmodelElement]. When the de-serializer encounters the
property ``submodelElements`` as an array and starts de-serializing its items, how can
it know which constructor to call to parse the item? This necessary nugget of
information is commonly called "discriminator" (*e.g.*,
see [OpenAPI 3 specification on polymorphism]).

[SubmodelElement]: https://industrialdigitaltwin.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IDTA-01001-3-0_SpecificationAssetAdministrationShell_Part1_Metamodel.pdf#page=63

[OpenAPI 3 specification on polymorphism]: https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/inheritance-and-polymorphism/

We define the discriminator for our serialization as an additional property, `modelType`
, which do not correspond to any attribute in the meta-model. Every class which has one
or more descendants will have the discriminator `modelType` in its definition.

When a deserializer needs to de-serialize an instance of an abstract class, it can do so
by dispatching the de-serialization to the appropriate de-serialization method based
on `modelType`.

### Enumerations

The enumerations of the meta-model are directly mapped
to [enumerated values in JSON schema]. Each enumeration is defined separately, and we do
not in-line enumerations for readability.

[enumerated values in JSON schema]: https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/generic.html#enumerated-values

Enumerations which are not directly used in the schema are omitted. For example, subsets
of [KeyTypes] are omitted since only [KeyTypes] is used to define value of an attribute.

[KeyTypes]: https://industrialdigitaltwin.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IDTA-01001-3-0_SpecificationAssetAdministrationShell_Part1_Metamodel.pdf#page=85

### Embedded Data Specifications

The meta-model defines data specifications in abstract (see
Section [6 Predefined Data Specification Templates]). However, the meta-model omits data
specifications in an [Environment], and data specifications are intentionally
non-identifiable.

[6 Predefined Data Specification Templates]: https://industrialdigitaltwin.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IDTA-01001-3-0_SpecificationAssetAdministrationShell_Part1_Metamodel.pdf#page=106

For practical applications, we need to access them *somehow*. Therefore, the meta-model
mandates to embed them in serializations (see
Section [7.2.5 Embedded Data Specifications]).

[7.2.5 Embedded Data Specifications]: https://industrialdigitaltwin.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IDTA-01001-3-0_SpecificationAssetAdministrationShell_Part1_Metamodel.pdf#page=114

We consequently embed the data specifications by adding `embeddedDataSpecifications`
property to the definition corresponding to [HasDataSpecification], and deliberately
omit the attribute [HasDataSpecification]/``dataSpecification`` in the schema.

[HasDataSpecification]: https://industrialdigitaltwin.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IDTA-01001-3-0_SpecificationAssetAdministrationShell_Part1_Metamodel.pdf#page=48

## Examples

Examples of the JSON serializations can be found in [schemas/json/examples/](examples)
folder.

## Background

### From Manual Transcription ...

The serialization to and from JSON changed over the course of different versions of the
meta-model. Originally, the schema had been manually designed, where a group of authors
combed "the book" and manually transcribed it to JSON schema. This was obviously
error-prone as it often caused mismatches between other serializations (*e.g.*, XML and
RDF), contained inconsistencies *etc.*

### ... to Automatic Generation

We eventually moved over to generate the serialization schemas based on a
single-point-of-truth. The current source is [aas-core-meta], a domain-specific Python
representation of the meta-model. The schemas are generated using [aas-core-codegen], a
translating tool which transpiles aas-core-meta into different schemas and other targets
such as SDKs.

[aas-core-meta]: https://github.com/aas-core-works/aas-core-meta

[aas-core-codegen]: https://github.com/aas-core-works/aas-core-codegen

While this approach reduced the rate of errors significantly, it also imposed certain
limits on our schema design. For example, the classes and enumerations are now
programmatically mapped to JSON definitions, allowing for no exceptions. Where we could
in-line some of them for better readability, we are now forced to stick with the
programmatic definitions.
